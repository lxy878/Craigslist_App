Would prefer to find something within a 20-minute drive from the South Slope, but am open to Brooklyn locations outside of that.  I can go as high as $1,000 (meaning $2000/mo. rent split two ways), but would prefer to keep it to under $900 ($1,800/mo.).

content="Single 42 yo needs a room for rent.   Can be furnished or unfurnished.  No credit check please.  Not gonna happen.. I work steady for three years and prior was 16 years at the same place...and I can provide source of my weekly income.  Reason no credit check is I had a great job for 16 years and they did a reduction in force and I was laid off, thus struggled to find work and made a choice to pay my rent and eat instead of paying cards off.   That is the reason.  Not because I’m a low life.  I don’t smoke I have bad asthma.  I don’t cook if I do it’s rarely.  I leave the house 5am Monday through Friday returning 5pm approximately. I’m usually home weekends and I don’t go out much and I don’t party.  Me having a place to sleep is my party :) [newLine][newLine]Reason why I need a place is  I currently rent a  huge one bedroom apartment in Belle Harbor..have my own parking space and all is included, including cable and I have my own heating thermostat ... when I first moved in, my rent was $925...I have been here for four years and raising my rent every single year.  The first year she raised my rent $225 a month..no joke.    She also rents the two parking spaces in front of me.  I’m very quiet and I pay for my rent every two weeks and I get paid weekly if that is better for you.    I just need a break and I can’t seem to get ahead with her unreasonable rent increases.  [newLine][newLine]Please feel free to email me or text me...if you call me, I may not hear the phone, but leave a message and I’ll call you back.      I just wanted to add to this since I said I have bad asthma,  I can’t be around any animals at all because it will send me to the hospital   [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

content="Single 42 yo needs a room for rent. Can be furnished or unfurnished. No credit check please. Not gonna happen.. I work steady for three years and prior was 16 years at the same place...and I can provide source of my weekly income. Reason no credit check is I had a great job for 16 years and they did a reduction in force and I was laid off, thus struggled to find work and made a choice to pay my rent and eat instead of paying cards off. That is the reason. Not because I’m a low life. I don’t smoke I have bad asthma. I don’t cook if I do it’s rarely. I leave the house 5am Monday through Friday returning 5pm approximately. I’m usually home weekends and I don’t go out much and I don’t party. Me having a place to sleep is my party :) [newLine][newLine]Reason why I need a place is I currently rent a huge one bedroom apartment in Belle Harbor..have my own parking space and all is included, including cable and I have my own heating thermostat ... when I first moved in, my rent was $925...I have been here for four years and raising my rent every single year. The first year she raised my rent $225 a month..no joke. She also rents the two parking spaces in front of me. I’m very quiet and I pay for my rent every two weeks and I get paid weekly if that is better for you. I just need a break and I can’t seem to get ahead with her unreasonable rent increases. [newLine][newLine]Please feel free to email me or text me...if you call me, I may not hear the phone, but leave a message and I’ll call you back. I just wanted to add to this since I said I have bad asthma, I can’t be around any animals at all because it will send me to the hospital [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Thanks for your time.[newLine][newLine]"

We have over 25 years of experience and have a great reputation for being honest and fair. The corporation buys about 30-55 buildings a year, depending on the market situation. The condition of the property is almost irrelevant, as we buy all-cash, no inspection contingency. In many cases we don't need access just send us the building size, location, and asking price, and we will get back to you very soon. We can take occupied houses that need eviction, boarded-up properties, and buildings with violations. A closing can be scheduled if necessary in 3 days, and we can deal with complicated situations (privacy, tenants, violations, etc.) Property locators, Real Estate agents, and other developers who are willing to flip at a price that still makes sense are all welcome to contact us. We are willing to sign "time is of the essence, on or before" to assure seller we are ready able and willing to close, and we pay finder's fee. -Thank you for your attention.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Golden Buildings LLC[newLine][newLine]https://www.goldenbuildingsllc.com[newLine][newLine]"

IF YOU ARE NOT RENTING A ROOM IN THE TOWNS I LISTED THEN DO NOT RESPOND, SERIOUSLY. I REPEAT, DON’T CONTACT ME IF YOU’RE NOT RENTING IN THE LISTED COMMUNITIES.

(15-30 MINUTES to CITY, DEPENDING ON TIME OF DAY/TRAFFIC.) OR WALK 8 MINUTES (REALLY!) TO 30TH STREET WHERE BUSES AND JITNEYS RUN CONSTANTLY.[newLine][newLine]*HOBOKEN in Minutes VIA NJ Transit #22 https://moovitapp.com/lines?metroId=121&amp;lgid=432947&amp;lid=1514076&amp;t=1[newLine][newLine]*CLOSE TO ALL MAJOR HIGHWAYS.[newLine][newLine]*OFF STREET PARKING SPACE AVAILABLE FOR $150 - PER MONTH OR LANDLORD PROVIDES FREE PERMIT FOR LEGAL STREET PARKING.[newLine][newLine]* FIOS/WIFI, SECURITY SYSTEM &amp; ALL UTILITIES INCLUDED IN RENT[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Got lots of questions?  Read below!![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]*Me: I'm a clean, organized, educated stable female adult, who teaches Pilates, Yoga and Nutrition. As I often work from home, it's best to share with someone whose work takes them out of the house during traditional business hours. There is a small sweet well behaved (mostly!) low allergen dog who lives here too.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]*You: COUPLES THANKS FOR YOUR INTEREST, BUT THIS IS FOR ONE PERSON ONLY.  Please, be a roommate who can provide proper references, and is considerate, kind, mature, willing to clean up after themselves, pays their bills on time, and enjoys a happy busy life outside the home. Although not a deal breaker, special consideration given to those who do light cooking .[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]*Area and House: If you're not familiar with the neighborhood, it's truly a hidden gem. Our street is the border betweenWeehawken &amp; Union City. Residential, quiet, safe, and well situated. Nearby there's convenience stores, restaurants, Trader Joe's &amp;  Whole Foods at the bottom of our hill. Hoboken is a short Uber away, $4-7.   Easy to access  NJ Transit buses and privately run jitneys, land you in midtown Manhattan quickly, faster than most parts of Brooklyn! 15-30 minutes depending on time of day/traffic. Also close to major highways.[newLine][newLine]The circa 1900's rowhouse, overlooks Reservoir Park, which has a running/walking track around the perimeter, &amp; great NYC skyline views, and no doubt contributes to the peaceful feeling of the neighborhood. The house could definitely benefit from cosmetic updating, yet, it's kept clean, &amp;  everything works as it should. There's a full kitchen, w/dw, dining room, living room, and a single shared bathroom, that's kept clean!  (Do you notice a theme here?  ;) Off street parking may be available as well.  It's a modest, cozy little home, perfect for 2 grown up people to share. Perhaps you're like me, and you enjoy a quiet safe enclave that's just a short distance away from the center of things, with only one other roommate.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]*Bedroom: Your bedroom is 12'x11, ceilings 8.5'. with a reach in closet, two windows overlooking the backyard, a ceiling fan, a/c provided when weather heats up. The view is green, w/lovely afternoon light.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]*The single bathroom is shared. Despite the worn original tiles &amp; fixtures it's kept clean, and I'd appreciate a roommate who's willing to clean up after themselves. I'll surely do the same for you.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]*The washer is located in the cellar and is available for an extra $35 monthly. There are also several laundromats within walking distance, if you prefer.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]*Rental Terms: Although roommates have stayed a year or more, and is preferred, the rental is month to month. Shorter stays will be considered for the right person. Rent is due the 1st day of each month. If your move in date isn't the first of the month, your rent will be prorated. First months rent and deposit due upon moving in. Your deposit, 1.5 months rent, will be returned, minus any damages, when you move out and return the keys.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]* Please include a valid phone#, accessible social media link,  &amp; a little info about you, in your response. if you want me to know you read the entire ad, put "Reddit" in the subject line.  Thanks.[newLine][newLine]"

content="            [newLine][newLine]            [newLine][newLine]            [newLine][newLine]            [newLine][newLine]            [newLine][newLine]            [newLine][newLine]This is a GREAT, 1400 SQ. FT., RENOVATED 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apt.  The share is with two male roommates and possibly 2 very well-behaved brother-cats or a single red tabby cat (the related cats are owned by the current third roommate, who would be leaving, while the red tabby belongs to a friend in the building who is away a good deal).  The cat(s) would eat and use their litter box in my bathroom and stay primarily in my bedroom.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The share is in a well-maintained building ON CENTRAL PARK NORTH, JUST WEST OF FIFTH AVENUE, directly across the street from the Park and the northern lake - a very nice block and area.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There is a laundry room in the basement, and the living room has a GREAT, panoramic view of the Park, the northern lake, and a city view of the Upper West and East Side, all the way down Fifth Avenue to the Empire State Building.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Thirty days after a new roommate commits to a move-in by signing a written agreement, preferably for a 9/30/19 move-in, and by paying the holding fee and the final month's rent, the 150-foot bedroom, with access to the semi-private bathroom (shared with one person), will be available for a move-in, with at least the first month's rent due upon the move-in.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The rent is $1,700 for the bedroom.  A longer term commitment is preferred if possible, preferably until at least May 15th or May 31st.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The 150-foot bedroom has a new, high-quality mattress and a new box spring, on a metal bed frame; a nightstand; a high, narrow, white shelving unit; a low, natural wood bookcase; a large, double-door walk-in closet with a hanging pole, two large shelves and a large floor space for shoes, luggage, etc.  A quality Dhurrie or Killim area rug is available if desired, as are some art works by well-known artists if desired.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The bedroom is lockable from inside and outside; it can be locked by turning a knob feature and closing the door.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The room has very good natural light until around 3 P.M. (the large window faces east), and excellent overhead lighting.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]You would use the apartment's hallway door to enter the semi-private bathroom, the other roommate uses a bathroom-access door in his bedroom, and BOTH THE HALLWAY DOOR AND THE BEDROOM DOOR TO THE BATHROOM LOCK FROM INSIDE THE BATHROOM FOR PRIVACY.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Moderate smoking in the bedroom is OK if you keep the window partially open and air the room out periodically.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]My bedroom is in the other wing of the apt., on the other side of the far living room wall, with a separate bathroom.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I smoke cigarettes occasionally, but only moderately, almost always in my bedroom (which is far away from the other bedrooms), occasionally in the living room, but only when no one else is there.  I smoke in my bedroom only with my door closed, with a charcoal barrier at the bottom of my door, and two windows open.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The available bedroom has a new air conditioner with the highest energy-efficiency rating, so summer electric bills are reasonable.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The A/C has numerous settings and features:  you can set it to a constant temperature, for a set number of hours, on 3 fan settings to regulate the cooling, or you can set it to fan on 3 settings, or set the A/C to economy to reduce electricity consumption -- then the A/C goes off and on according to the room and temperature you set.  You can also set it to constantly cool.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]THE APT. AREA:  6 BLOCKS EAST OF THE MORNINGSIDE HTS./COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AREA (Broadway and Cathedral Pkwy), AND ACROSS THE STREET FROM UPPER CARNEGIE HILL AND MUSEUM MILE. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Parking is easy and very safe on Central Park North and surrounding blocks, due to few parking restrictions and police patrols.  There are also two inexpensive garages a block away.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The block and area are very safe, clean, airy, and relaxing.  They're not congested with traffic, crowded, or noisy, unlike the midtown and farther downtown areas -- but this area and Morningside Heights (6 blocks west) has a number of restaurants, bars and nightclubs nearby, frequented mostly by area residents, Columbia University affiliates and tourists.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]It also takes very little time to get to Harlem nightclubs and restaurants on 116th St., the Red Rooster near 125th St., and midtown and downtown places.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Revaluate.com gives the building and area a very high rating - 92 or 93.  The address can be given to check on revaluate.  The rating is even higher than the one for the mid-rise building and area I lived in when I was in Murray Hill.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]THE APT. HAS:  HARDWOOD FLOORS; HIGH CEILINGS; A LARGE (180 sq. ft.) EAT-IN KITCHEN (W/STONE FLOOR AND WHITE CERAMIC COUNTER AND WALL TILES); THICK WALLS; AND COLORED, RECESSED LIGHTING IN THE HALL AND LIVING ROOM.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]THE APT. HAS A GOOD LAYOUT FOR SHARING:  There are 2 wings.  The hall wing has a 150' bedroom, then the 175' bedroom, then the semi-private bathroom, then the kitchen, and then the living room, so no hall bedroom is next to the kitchen.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The second wing is on the other side of the far living room wall, with another bedroom and bathroom.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]THE APT. IS AN ACTUAL 3BR/2BA apt., not a conversion, flex, or an apt. with added divider walls.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]THE LARGE EAT-IN KITCHEN is 180 sq. ft. and square, NOT a narrow, galley-style kitchen.  It has a large round glass table with chairs, A LARGE DISHWASHER, LARGE FRIG., LARGE STOVETOP/OVEN, LARGE MICROWAVE, toaster oven, toaster, Crockpot, other cooking equipment, etc. and GOOD CABINET SPACE.[newLine][newLine]The kitchen doesn't get crowded.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There's also a large rectangular glass table in the living room that can be used for dining.  It seats six.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]The other guy and I cook occasionally, he usually makes a breakfast and a dinner.  I sometimes cook but more often bring prepared food in, have delivery, or warm up leftover food.  There are numerous restaurants within walking distance and lots of restaurants deliver to the building.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]THE APT. HAS CABLE AND WIFI.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The steam heat (not dry, forced air) and hot water are excellent and free.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There are no electricity, central heating or central air-conditioning outages, like the ones that can occur in the nearby high-rises.  Those buildings have also had many plumbing problems and even some fires that have caused smoke damage to entire floors.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There's plenty of ventilation from the apartment's 10 windows, and breezes from the park bring lots of fresh air into the apt.  The apt. never gets too hot or cold, unlike in many NYC apartment buildings.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]THE BUILDING:  Faces south on the Park, with an awning, gardens in front and along the entrance walk, and a marble lobby and stairs.  The apartment is 3 flights up from the lobby/1st floor. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The building is very solid, w/25 quiet units, as opposed to many units with thin walls.  Most of the residents are professionals and students, and the neighbors are pleasant and very quiet.  There is no noise from other apts.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]BLDG. AND AREA SECURITY:  The apt has an intercom and buzzer for two security doors. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The tree-lined block and building are very well-lit and the entire area is very safe, even in the early morning hours (1-7 A.M.).  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There are police cameras and patrols on Central Park North; patrol cars drive around the Park, the lake, and throughout the area; and walking home from the #2, 3 and 6 subways is safe at all hours.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Because living near the Park is so desirable, there are two new large condos, at Fifth and Lenox Avenues, others up and down Fifth Avenue, and there are other condos and co-ops on the block and in the general area. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]GENERAL LIVABILITY:  Apts. on Central Park North and in the area are desirable because the area has a better quality of life than crowded, noisy and traffic-congested areas of Manhattan with little or no green space.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The Park is open from 6 A.M. until 1 A.M.  People walk their dogs, run around the Lake, play sports, suntan, and picnic on the lawns and walk, hike and rock climb.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There are biking, walking, running and wooded hiking paths directly across the street in the Park.  There's a pool and ice hockey/ice skating rink one block into the Park.  There's a New York Sports Club 5 blocks north and a Bally 6 blocks southeast. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Museum Mile starts 4 blocks south on Fifth Avenue; Mt. Sinai Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Columbia U., Teachers College, Bank Street College and the Manhattan School of Music are all within 10 to 18 minutes from the building by walking or by bus, a maximum of 10-12 minutes by subway. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]TRANSPORTATION:  The block is extremely well-located for transportation:[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]It's 10-11 minutes to West Midtown on the #2 or #3 express (from the Central Park North/110th St. Station, one-half block west of the bldg, only 1 stop north of 96th St.); 16-18 minutes to East Midtown on the #6 Lexington Ave. local (3 blocks east at 110th and Lexington) and then the #4 or #5 express at 86th St.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Downtown is 20 minutes away on the 2 or 3, or 20-22 minutes on the #6 and then the 4 or 5.  The #2, 3 &amp; 6 usually have no delays in this area.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The uptown/crosstown #2, 3 and 4 Madison Avenue buses stop next door to the building, and the #4 gets you to Columbia U. in 10-12 minutes (a 10-15 minute walk. depending on how fast one walks).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The downtown #1, 2, 3 and 4 Fifth Avenue buses, to the East Village and Penn Station, stop across the street.  The building is 6 blocks east of the #1 subway (a transfer from the #4 westbound bus).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]SHOPPING:  There are two very good supermarkets only 1 and a half blocks to the east and west.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There's a deli next door and the great West Side Market is 6 blocks west at Broadway and Cathedral Parkway/110th St., with a huge selection of produce (including organic), meat, fresh fish and seafood, lots of prepared hot and cold international and standard foods, a gourmet and cheese section, and a large deli and salad bar section.  It's like Whole Foods but somewhat less expensive.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There are also 3 excellent fresh fish and seafood markets, including wild fish, 3 and 4 blocks away.  These markets also fry or steam fish, seafood, and vegetables at no extra charge.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]At least first and final month's rent, plus a $200 holding fee, later to be used as a security deposit, will be requested.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]You'll be asked to give the $200 holding fee within a few days after seeing the room or the room will be rentable by someone else.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The final month's rent should be paid as soon as possible after payment of the holding fee/security, but definitely before the move-in, as when one rents an apartment (then two months rent is usually requested in advance of the move-in).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The first and any additional  month's rents agreed upon will be due before or on the day of the move-in, depending on how soon the move-in will be.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Personal checks and receipts from certified checks (with all necessary details), constitute legal receipts.  If any cash is given, a written receipt with all details to constitute a legal receipt will be provided and signed by both of us.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Once you've paid the required rent and have your receipts, you will have a legally enforceable right to move in, and the agreement cannot "fall through."[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Total move-in cost for the 150-foot bedroom will be $3,600 (or more, depending upon whether additional month's rents are agreed upon).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Utility charges per person vary, generally $75-$80 per person per month, except in summer, when they are almost never more than $100, even with heavy A/C usage.  We might negotiate on the utilities, depending on use.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]A longer-term commitment is preferred.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]THE ROOMMATES:  I'm a Columbia Law grad who worked at two private sector firms and then in the legal department of the NYS Division of Human Rights.  I currently do research, memoranda and motion drafting for my cousin's practice and I do legal editing for students and submissions to legal journals.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]My schedule varies and I sometimes work at home (15-20 hours a week, if I can work at home).  I do most of my research and drafting at the Columbia Law School library.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I'm easygoing, clean, and always respect people's privacy and need for quiet.  I cook only occasionally and usually warm up purchased food, eat out, or order delivery.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The other guy, who is relaxed, clean, and respectful of people, works as a data engineer in AI.  We are both friendly and can sometimes socialize if our third roommate wants to.  He sometimes cooks breakfast, leaves for work between 8 and 8:45, and usually cooks dinner between 6 and 6:30.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Visitors and occasional overnight guests are OK as long as you know them well, and don't have frequent overnights.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The other guy never has visitors and I rarely have visitors because all of my friends are in their own NYC apartments or shares.  Neither of us has overnight guests.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There may be two well-behaved, black and white "Tuxedo" brother-cats that the current third roommate may temporarily leave for a while, while he gets settled in his new place, or a red tabby owned by a friend in the building who is currently away a lot.  If there are any cats, they would primarily stay in my bedroom, and have their litter box, food and water in my bathroom.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Limited exceptions about overnights can be agreed upon, depending on the frequency and length, to avoid problems with kitchen and bathroom use.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Both of us roommates tend to keep to ourselves when home, and we're pretty quiet when others are around.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Please don't inquire if you:  smoke weed regularly; drink heavily or use drugs; work at home full-time; run a business from home; or are involved with someone who will be in the apartment a lot.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]We would like someone who is relaxed and who will clean up behind him/herself in the common areas.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I vacuum and clean every couple of weeks in addition to doing some other cleaning and sharing in common area chores. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Older undergrads, grad students, postdoc students, resident fellows, long-term interns, contract employees, or permanent, full-time employees are all fine.  A reference of some sort would be appreciated.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Thanks a lot for your patience in reading this long description. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

title="Mature Woman Needs Cat-Friendly Space"
type="article"
content="            [newLine][newLine]I am a mature, 44 yr. old, single, child-free woman with one cat seeking an unfurnished room, or if it’s furnished, I need room for my bookshelf, desk &amp; chair, &amp; platform double bed. It has a fold-up light-weight metal frame, so it’s super easy on hardwood floors. I also need adequate closet space for my clothes. I can pay about $400 – 450/mo. I am on permanent disability, so I cannot pay a deposit at this time, but I can pay a little extra each month until it has accumulated. I can no longer afford to stay here. It will likely take my whole check to move. My income isn’t much, but it is pretty steady. I’m looking to move out the 1st week of Sept., no earlier than the 3rd, as that is when I get my check. I will be looking able to work part-time soon, once I've had a chance to sleep and have peace &amp; quiet. I also love to cook and sometimes try out new recipes. Let me know if you’re willing to be my recipe taster.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Here’s a little bit about me:[newLine][newLine]•	Cat lover[newLine][newLine]•	Night owl[newLine][newLine]•	Eco-conscious: use mostly Earth-friendly products (e.g. Seventh Generation; BioKleen; Method; etc.) And I insist on recycling[newLine][newLine]•	Health &amp; diet conscious[newLine][newLine]•	Foodie who loves to cook, I eat awesome whole, natural food[newLine][newLine]•	Neo-pagan[newLine][newLine]•	Alternative-minded[newLine][newLine]•	Love Goth fashion, used to frequent Goth clubs in the 90s &amp; early 2000s, but rarely go clubbing anymore[newLine][newLine]•	Have very eclectic taste in music (I listen to everything from Gothic to Gospel)[newLine][newLine]•	Creative: I read, write, paint, draw, color, play The Sims 3, &amp; watch TV/Movies[newLine][newLine]•	Avid Sci-Fi/Fantasy fan[newLine][newLine]•	I AM the muffin (wo)man. My muffins are fantastic! I would love to find someone to share them with. I can make gluten-free or low-carb stuff too![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]What I need/want:[newLine][newLine]•	No loud bass-heavy music, no party speakers[newLine][newLine]•	Non-smoking, I use an electronic cigarette only, 420 doesn’t bother me[newLine][newLine]•	Cat-friendly &amp; safe for my furry girl. She’s an indoor cat, must not be let outside, even if she tries to trick you[newLine][newLine]•	Close to public transportation, laundry, library, post office, &amp; supermarket if possible.[newLine][newLine]•	Childfree home[newLine][newLine]•	2nd floor or lower[newLine][newLine]•	AC or space to install one for myself[newLine][newLine]•	Peaceful &amp; calm environment[newLine][newLine]•	Hard floors, no carpet[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I am home most of the time. But I keep to myself and won’t bother you. I just need peace so that I can think &amp; work on my writing &amp; hopefully build up my freelance work-from-home business again. My cat is spayed &amp; very sweet, but frightened of strangers so she will be with me most of the time. I don’t bring the party home either. So no drunken one-night stands waking you in the middle of the night. I’m too old for that. If I have people over it will be announced before-hand most likely. I prefer another mature individual who loves cats as much as I do to share with, and while I’m not looking to make new friends, I would like us to have some sort of rapport &amp; mutual respect. I have many limitations so I need a calm environment in which to manage my conditions. I go to bed at 3 am during the work week and usually get up between noon &amp; 1 pm. And between 1 &amp; 2 pm on weekends. I order many of my major needs online so I need to be able to receive packages easily or be near the local post office. But I understand mail sometimes sucks in some areas. I’m an extreme night owl. But I will not disturb you if you’re a day walker. If you don’t already recycle, I will sort the recycling every week.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Direct contact from renters only please. I won’t reply to text-only communication or click any links sent. And I’m not interested in any romantic arrangements either, as I’m asexual. Please call me after 1 pm. If I don’t answer please leave a message. My neighbors often play very loud music at night on weekends, so I may not hear the phone, as it necessitates earplugs. But I will get back to you just as soon as I have a quiet moment.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I prefer to live downtown Newark or someplace that is near the PATH train or accessible by MetroCard. I lived in NYC for 20 years before relocating to Newark.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Thank you[newLine][newLine]"

I am NOT an employee of the landlord, I am NOT a real estate person, NOR do I work on commission.  I do however occupy the premises and volunteer my time facilitating communications and repairs within the property.  I work full-time as a public servant in the engineering field so my time is limited (ergo, serious inquiries only).  I am invested, professional and responsive and ask for all potential renters to reciprocate in kind.  I pride myself on being transparent, an innate problem-solver and a straight-shooter.  Should you be financially, physically or mentally unstable I am NOT qualified to pursue a relationship with you much less one that yields a long-term communal housing situation.  We are only pursuing good fits and do not require full occupancy.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Actively seeking to establish and maintain a communal household comprised of driven individuals trying to educationally and/or professionally elevate themselves within the NYC metropolitan area.  If you are opposed to occasionally sharing household meals, group activities, or are unable to comply with NYC Department of Sanitation's recycling ordinances then chances are we are NOT compatible.  Recycling is of the upmost importance in this household so if you are into a green way of living i.e. recycling beyond NYC ordinances, composting, sustainability efforts, healthy eating, up-cycling, etc., we NEED your camaraderie.  Although we understand the shared situations are not for everyone, we have been trying to provide an alternative platform that can allot for a positive communal experience and promulgate further success within the community.  Our goal is to establish a household best described as driven, educated, preferably recently employed and/or actively enrolled in a vocational/higher education institution (i.e. undergrad/grad/trades school) but most importantly a stress-free environment.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]neigh·bor·hood /ˈnābərˌho͝od/  Despite being an up-and-coming area, the Bronx has not been able to rid itself of its bad reputation (acquired during the large exodus by the Jewish community in the 1970s).  You are encouraged to research the surrounding area but if you are white, black, yellow, tangerine, etc. chances of you being a victim of a violent crime are slim (although Manhattan can catch you off-guard with its cramped overpriced quarters and susceptibility to random acts of terrorism/aging infrastructure failures).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]North of Yankee Stadium, nestled within a hilly enclave of Art Deco apartment complexes, Tudor and Victorian homes, Morrisania is an affordable NYC corridor with a quiet community-oriented vibe.  With plenty of places to connect with neighbors, there are multiple weekly green markets, a handful of dance and yoga studios, as well as friendly bodegas, hair salons and delis.  The recently reopened historic High Bridge, which connects Washington Heights and the Highbridge neighborhood in the Bronx, offers an easy pedestrian and bicycle route to upper Manhattan.  In addition, the new Harlem River Greenway, along 20 acres of the Harlem River waterfront, has waterfront parkland that connects pedestrian walk ways, bicycling access, and jogging trails which really has given this area a long needed facelift and restored the community's historic access to the waterfront.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]spe·cif·ics /spəˈsifiks/  The home is located on a quiet tree-lined street that is predominantly populated with 2- and 3-family dwellings and a cluster of rent-stabilized apartment buildings at its core.  Our biggest short-coming is the lack of venues for take-out/dining-in.  Although, Hungry Bird (a quaint neighborhood restaurant serving Indian cuisine) and Justine's (another neighboring restaurant serving Dominican cuisine) are within walking distance.  More importantly, deliveries for your avid Grubhub and Seamless user are available.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]ad·ver·tise·ment /ˈadvərˌtīzmənt/ Two (2) housemate openings available in a furnished 2nd Floor, 4-Bedroom/1-Bath, co-ed apartment-share (asking $975/mo. and $1,175/mo., single-occupancy only).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]dis·clo·sure / disˈklōZHər/ You will need to schedule a viewing of the premise in order to get the ball rolling (bring a friend since you will be visiting a stranger's home).  Next, you will need to meet the members of the household as to assess if we are a good fit.  After we meet and iron out any mutual concerns we can then move onto the next step, i.e. the application process.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Viewing the premises does not incur a fee but interested applicants are encouraged, contingent on our compatibility, to complete a lease application after the viewing.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There is a single $75.00 application fee per applicant (which includes a $36.98 amount that would be directly payable via credit card to E-Renter.com) and this one application fee allows you to apply for any or all of the vacancies at the time of the application process.  Submissions of incomplete lease applications will NOT be considered.  During the application process the room you are interested in will be removed from the market and placed on hold (for a maximum of 48 hours).  However, if your annual salary is NOT equal to or greater than 33x-40x one month's rent then hold on to both your cash and personal information.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Upon successful completion of the application process a move-in date is set at which time the first and last month's rent plus one (1) month security deposit will be required (move-in dates must be established within five (5) calendar days after completion of the application process).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]con·clu·sion /kənˈklo͞oZHən/ To be considered a potential candidate you MUST meet the requirements disclosed above in addition to being considerate, clean, smoke-free, ethical, independent, laid-back and resourceful[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Also, seeking a skilled trades-person (i.e. experienced property manager/superintendent, carpenter, electrician, plumber, etc.) for paid/barter situation yielding an additional source of income for prospective housemate(s): general home improvement - $20-$40 per hour (contingent on project and skill aptitude).

We’re ISO a lady with good vibes to welcome into our home![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]THE BEDROOM[newLine][newLine]With one closet and one window, this unfurnished room is able to fit a full bed while leaving space for additional furniture, or can fit a queen bed if that’s your style. A window AC is recommended for the summer months. You’ll share a bathroom with only one other person, who takes short showers and cleans her hair out of the drain afterwards (it’s the little things).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]THE APARTMENT[newLine][newLine]Our place is on the top floor of a three family unit. The apartment itself is sunny throughout the day with high ceilings and a balcony. That being so, we like to keep various plants in our common area and have an herb garden. Two people are able to use the kitchen with ease and the common area fits our full dining table plus a sectional couch. There is no laundry in the building, but there’s a laundromat a few blocks away of Steinway street as well as others closer to Ditmars. [newLine][newLine]The lease states no pets are allowed. Utilities (heat, electric, internet) are split three ways each month.[newLine][newLine]The apartment is across the street from a playground as well as less than a block from (arguably) the best grocery store, pizza place, and brewery in the neighborhood.[newLine][newLine]A walk to the Astoria-Ditmars Blvd. station on the N/W is approx. 12 minutes (less if you’re a speed walker). It’s two blocks from the Q101 bus and offers free street parking. One of us has a car here and has never parked more than a block from the apartment or spent more than five minutes looking for a spot.[newLine][newLine]The apartment is in a residential area and just a couple of blocks from lots of (incredible) restaurants, bars, and nightlife, as well as an short walk from Astoria Park. The immediate area is a safe and quiet removal from Manhattan’s atmosphere with authentic Astoria energy.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]THE ROOMMATES[newLine][newLine]We are two professional, single ladies in their late-twenties working in publishing and television. We like to order in on Fridays and find a movie to watch just as much as we like to have a night out in the neighborhood and meet up with fellow Astoria dwellers. Favorite shows include Big Little Lies, Euphoria, Outlander, The Crown, Survivor, and (almost) anything Bravo. [newLine][newLine]Both of us have lived here for several years and are looking for a lady (sorry guys) with a full-time job to join our home![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]INTERESTED[newLine][newLine]"

[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]This apartment is in a fantastic location in Crown Heights/Prospect Heights border. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]About Me:[newLine][newLine]I'm a pretty laid back, single lady. I like to go out with friends but I don't have a ton of company over at the apartment cause I like my chill time. When I get home from work, I tend to get comfy on the couch with a nice bottle of wine for some tv watching. I'm looking for someone with a similar lifestyle. Someone who doesn't have a ton of company over each night. Someone who doesn't have their bf/gf staying over ALL of the time.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]My schedule is pretty routine. Monday through Friday, I usually get up around 7:30am to get ready for work and out the door by 8:15am.  I typically get back home around 6:30/7pm if I don't go to the gym or out with friends after work.  I don't work on the wknds and like to sleep in if I don't have the energy to make my morning gym class lol[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I'd prefer someone with opposite schedules like we have presently at my place but that's not mandatory.  That has worked out really well for us.  It can get cramped with 4 roommates so someone who travels, has opposite schedules, and doesn't work from home is ideal for me but I'm totally flexible.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]At times, I can be a big homebody where I'll be home each night after work and on the wknds.  But I am also very social and like to go out a few times a week. So it totally varies. Sometimes you'll see me everyday and sometimes you won't see me for a few days.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I don't cook. I order take out a lot. So if you're a big foodie, HAVE AT IT! The kitchen is all yours! As long as cooking doesn't happen too late at night with really smelly foods :) [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]One of my roommates who's leaving is one of my best friends so we hung out in the apt together a lot. The other two girls were friendly but just roommates. We didn't hang out much in or outside the apt which I am totally ok with.  Being friends and hanging out is NOT a requirement by any means. As long as there's mutual respect of work schedules, sleep schedules, and private space, then we're all good.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]So I think that's about it. If you think you'll be a good match, please drop me a line and we'll arrange a time for you to swing by so we can chat and you can check the place out![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Either way, good luck![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Things You'll Want To Know:[newLine][newLine]Month-to-Month Sublet (you won't be on the lease) / looking for long-term[newLine][newLine]1 of 4 bedrooms available on August 1st [newLine][newLine]1 Bathroom[newLine][newLine]Wifi[newLine][newLine]No Pets Allowed [newLine][newLine]Top Floor Unit[newLine][newLine]Spacious Common Area[newLine][newLine]Free Laundry in basement of building[newLine][newLine]Hardwood floors throughout apartment[newLine][newLine]Nice size kitchen with great light[newLine][newLine]Rooftop Access with great view[newLine][newLine]Backyard Access[newLine][newLine]Bike Storage[newLine][newLine]420 friendly[newLine][newLine]Plenty of bars, coffee shops and restaurants in surrounding area[newLine][newLine]Walking distance to Brooklyn Museum [newLine][newLine]Walking distance to Prospect Park[newLine][newLine]Short walk to the 2/3 trains on Eastern Parkway stop and Q train on 7th Ave stop[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Required for Move-In: First month and Security [newLine][newLine]$1200/month + utilities (available October 1st, 2019)[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Apartment is in the Financial District / South Street Seaport / City Hall area, close to all downtown subways and several bus lines. Walk to many neighborhoods (Tribeca, Battery Park, Chinatown, Wall St., Little Italy, Lower East Side, Soho, and more.) Very secure. Fully air-conditioned. Includes heat, electricity, water (all utilities) plus high speed Internet and cable-TV. Your own large bedroom (approx 11’ x 11’) includes a decent closet. Laundry room available in lobby, too.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]If interested, please write with details of why this is right for you, what your employment and living situation currently is, where you would go weekends (and for holidays). Month-to-month arrangement, but hoping to find someone for at least several months. (This situation isn’t for everyone -- please write if you think you’re a genuine match.) Available starting in mid September, exact start date is flexible.[newLine][newLine]"

The property is at the end of the paved part of the street, with only one neighbor on the opposite side.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Nicely located within 20 - 30 minutes drive from renowned shopping at Woodbury Commons, four season activities of Harriman Park, the Catskills and various Hudson River attractions.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]This is a fully conforming lot for building under the local Town code. Zoned "R-20/40", its primary construction area is the northernmost 90-100 feet (facing same direction as width of a house on Ingalls Street), with a 30 foot wide by about 120 feet long swale or rainwater runoff area, in its southern 200 feet by 101 feet portion. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]This area can become a private pond, with some appropriate landscaping. Imagine having an in-ground infinity pool overlooking your own private pond, to extend the water view! Please note, the parcel has no DEC or other restrictions that might block construction of a house and garage, shed, etc. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]* - note: address number is estimated, actual number is assigned upon permit application[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Please see the photo descriptions for some more specific details and to make sure you have more complete and useful information.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]1.

Remnant of old shed type building foundation is seen at the middle right edge of this picture.[newLine][newLine]8. This area can become a beautiful private pond! View of southern swale-type area that gathers rainwater at times. Has no effect on 'buildable' area of the property, and there are no "wetland" issues (there's no DEC or Fed, NWI designation).[newLine][newLine]9. Zoning map of a part of the Town of Wappinger, along with most of the Village of Wappingers Falls. The property is highlighted in orange (look a little above and to the right of the red "20/40" Zone label, on the map).

Chris Christie. You can see the river and NJ from the roof. This means you're a block away from the express A-train which lands you in midtown within 20 minutes, as well as minutes away from New Jersey which is directly across the bridge. The bus that stops almost in front of the building can take you directly to midtown east. I work at 42nd &amp; Madison and can hop on this bus there and end up in front of my apartment. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The occupants of the building are typically friendly and diverse: families, singles, retirees, Americans of various ethnic backgrounds, internationals, college students (Columbia is popular), actors, teachers, singers (opera is big), musicians, and I believe a couple of models (don't quote me) etc.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Next door, is a Columbia University facility and apartment complex, and just down the road you'll find Columbia Medical School and Hospital. The dorms are a few blocks away overlooking the river.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There are restaurants of many kinds that do deliver and quickly. If you're sportive, Riverside Park and Fort Tryon Park are minutes away. There are tennis courts in Riverside Park, just under the bridge. It's popular with Meetup.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The rent is $50/day, available from 9/1 until the morning of 9/7.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]NO DRUGS ALLOWED in the apartment, including weed/marijuana/spliff/joint, etc. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]You, however, are free to drink in moderation (ie no sloppy drunkenness). [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]We can talk more should we meet.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]If you're interested, please let me know. Unfortunately, I do not have any more pictures, cannot show it via skype nor consider anyone outside of NYC. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Regards,[newLine][newLine]"

Beautiful private outdoor space in the form of a large deck off the bedroom. You would have full access to this space too of course and if you enjoy gardening as I do, are welcome to plant whatever you like... space is fully equipt with lounge chairs, dining table and chairs, bbq grill, plants and fresh veggies and herbs you're welcome to as well. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The apartment has lots of original charm, large windows, moldings, very high ceilings, fireplace etc. The bedroom is not very big but is fully furnished with a queen-sized murphy bed, full-sized dresser, and full closet.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Looking for a professional, preferably also female, with a job outside the house (as I need the apartment to myself during the day to work), no drugs, no smoking, no drama or excessive loudness. Must be respectful, clean, considerate... just a generally pleasant, well-mannered person like myself. I have one very mellow cat who is the sweetest and will not bother you at all (but you must be OK with cats).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I love to cook and make homemade meals most nights, so I would be happy to share.

Steps from bus lines: Bx11, Bx32, Bx35 and Bx41; 10 minute walk from additional bus lines: Bx1, Bx2, Bx15, Bx18, BxM4 and subway lines: B, D and 4; the MetroNorth Station is less than half a mile away; and I-87 Major Deegan Expressway and I-95 Cross Bronx Expressway are nearby.

Double-occupancy (e.g. couples) places too much of a burden/hardship on the shared household resources.  For this reason, we are only considering single-occupancy of the furnished bedrooms (meaning no more than 4 flatmates during tenancy).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]First and last month's rent, plus one (1) month security deposit for all listed vacancies are required and non-negotiable (the first and last month rent are prorated as a courtesy).  Credit, housing and criminal background checks required for all prospective tenants (there is a one-time, non-refundable, application fee associated with the background check).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]To be considered a potential candidate:[newLine][newLine]a. You must be enrolled, or have recently accepted enrollment, in an accredited educational institution such as an undergraduate/graduate program, vocational/trade school, or are independently studying for professional certificate(s), certification(s) and/or license(s) such as The United States Medical Licensure Exam (USMLE), the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX), a "Bar Exam," etc.; or[newLine][newLine]b. You recently accepted, or have less than 3 years of employment, in an entry-level position; and[newLine][newLine]c. Your annual salary at a minimum is 33x the desired monthly rent (for actively enrolled undergraduate/graduate/vocational students), or 40x the desired monthly rent (for entry-level professionals); and[newLine][newLine]d. Your FICO credit score is above 674 (exceptions at landlord's discretion, no credit history permissible); and[newLine][newLine]e. You are ready and willing to discuss who you are and why you think you may be a good fit (such as: What you do for a living, if you are a smoker (e.g. cigarettes, marijuana, hookah), your current living situation, why you are looking to change it, how soon that change is foreseen, your experiences with overnight guests, overnight dishes, cooking, cleanliness, sharing, boundaries, etc.).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]bi·o / ˈbīō/  Since 1999 I have spearheaded a community effort by providing affordable housing to students and entry-level professionals willing to consider housing outside of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.  I am NOT an employee of the landlord, I am NOT a real estate person, NOR do I work on commission.  I do however occupy the premises and volunteer my time facilitating communications and repairs within the property.  I work full-time as a public servant in the engineering field so my time is limited (ergo, serious inquiries only).  I am invested, professional and responsive and ask for all potential renters to reciprocate in kind.  I pride myself on being transparent, an innate problem-solver and a straight-shooter.  Should you be financially, physically or mentally unstable I am NOT qualified to pursue a relationship with you much less one that yields a long-term communal housing situation.  We are only pursuing good fits and do not require full occupancy.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Actively seeking to establish and maintain a communal household comprised of driven individuals trying to educationally and/or professionally elevate themselves within the NYC metropolitan area.  If you are opposed to occasionally sharing household meals, group activities, or are unable to comply with NYC Department of Sanitation's recycling ordinances then chances are we are NOT compatible.  Recycling is of the upmost importance in this household so if you are into a green way of living i.e. recycling beyond NYC ordinances, composting, sustainability efforts, healthy eating, up-cycling, etc., we NEED your camaraderie.  Although we understand the shared situations are not for everyone, we have been trying to provide an alternative platform that can allot for a positive communal experience and promulgate further success within the community.  Our goal is to establish a household best described as driven, educated, preferably recently employed and/or actively enrolled in a vocational/higher education institution (i.e. undergrad/grad/trades school) but most importantly a stress-free environment.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]neigh·bor·hood /ˈnābərˌho͝od/  Despite being an up-and-coming area, the Bronx has not been able to rid itself of its bad reputation (acquired during the large exodus by the Jewish community in the 1970s).  You are encouraged to research the surrounding area but if you are white, black, yellow, tangerine, etc. chances of you being a victim of a violent crime are slim (although Manhattan can catch you off-guard with its cramped overpriced quarters and susceptibility to random acts of terrorism/aging infrastructure failures).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]North of Yankee Stadium, nestled within a hilly enclave of Art Deco apartment complexes, Tudor and Victorian homes, Morrisania is an affordable NYC corridor with a quiet community-oriented vibe.  With plenty of places to connect with neighbors, there are multiple weekly green markets, a handful of dance and yoga studios, as well as friendly bodegas, hair salons and delis.  The recently reopened historic High Bridge, which connects Washington Heights and the Highbridge neighborhood in the Bronx, offers an easy pedestrian and bicycle route to upper Manhattan.  In addition, the new Harlem River Greenway, along 20 acres of the Harlem River waterfront, has waterfront parkland that connects pedestrian walk ways, bicycling access, and jogging trails which really has given this area a long needed facelift and restored the community's historic access to the waterfront.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]spe·cif·ics /spəˈsifiks/  The home is located on a quiet tree-lined street that is predominantly populated with 2- and 3-family dwellings and a cluster of rent-stabilized apartment buildings at its core.  Our biggest short-coming is the lack of venues for take-out/dining-in.  Although, Hungry Bird (a quaint neighborhood restaurant serving Indian cuisine) and Justine's (another neighboring restaurant serving Dominican cuisine) are within walking distance.  More importantly, deliveries for your avid Grubhub and Seamless user are available.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]ad·ver·tise·ment /ˈadvərˌtīzmənt/ Two (2) housemate openings available in a furnished 2nd Floor, 4-Bedroom/1-Bath, co-ed apartment-share (asking $975/mo. and $1,175/mo., single-occupancy only).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]dis·clo·sure / disˈklōZHər/ You will need to schedule a viewing of the premise in order to get the ball rolling (bring a friend since you will be visiting a stranger's home).  Next, you will need to meet the members of the household as to assess if we are a good fit.  After we meet and iron out any mutual concerns we can then move onto the next step, i.e. the application process.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Viewing the premises does not incur a fee but interested applicants are encouraged, contingent on our compatibility, to complete a lease application after the viewing.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There is a single $75.00 application fee per applicant (which includes a $36.98 amount that would be directly payable via credit card to E-Renter.com) and this one application fee allows you to apply for any or all of the vacancies at the time of the application process.  Submissions of incomplete lease applications will NOT be considered.  During the application process the room you are interested in will be removed from the market and placed on hold (for a maximum of 48 hours).  However, if your annual salary is NOT equal to or greater than 33x-40x one month's rent then hold on to both your cash and personal information.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Upon successful completion of the application process a move-in date is set at which time the first and last month's rent plus one (1) month security deposit will be required (move-in dates must be established within five (5) calendar days after completion of the application process).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]con·clu·sion /kənˈklo͞oZHən/ To be considered a potential candidate you MUST meet the requirements disclosed above in addition to being considerate, clean, smoke-free, ethical, independent, laid-back and resourceful[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Also, seeking a skilled trades-person (i.e. experienced property manager/superintendent, carpenter, electrician, plumber, etc.) for paid/barter situation yielding an additional source of income for prospective housemate(s): general home improvement - $20-$40 per hour (contingent on project and skill aptitude).

The airy sun- drenched main level has an open concept LR and gourmet kitchen with SS appliances, quartz counters and tall white cabinets, 2BR’s, one with a laundry closet, and large bathroom. Upstairs is a private master bedroom loft with an en-suite bath. The bright, walkout basement has a separate entrance a bedroom and a full bathroom.[newLine][newLine]The neighborhood is conveniently close to everything. There are over 25 schools in this area, many within walking distance. Tons of shopping nearby including Bruckner Commons, Shop Rite, Target, Home Depot, TJ Maxx, Modells, Old Navy and more. For outdoors lovers, waterfront Clason Point and Pugsley Creek Parks are a few blocks away and offer nature trails, ball fields and an amazing unobstructed view of the river and Whitestone Bridge.  You can walk the trails, launch a canoe or kayak or just enjoy the scenery. The big, beautiful 205-acre Soundview Park is 1.4 miles away and offers sports fields and courts, playgrounds, running track, dog run and a long waterfront for hiking, biking, fishing and canoeing.  The performance lawn and amphitheater are home to free events and concerts all summer long.[newLine][newLine]Also great for commuters, with quick, easy access to Manhattan, Queens, Long Island and Westchester.

From single family homes to multifamily buildings, we buy around 30-50 houses a year for over 2 decades. We have a great reputation for being honest and fair, and unlike many of our competitors, we never cut an owner or a property locator at the closing. The condition of the property is almost irrelevant to us, as we buy As Is, All Cash, without inspection or mortgage contingencies. Furthermore, if necessary, we are willing to sign "time is of the essence" to assure the seller a fast closing in a timely manner. In many cases we don't even need an access to the building, just send us the building size, the about location, and the asking price, and we should be able to tell you right away if the price makes sense for us. We can take occupied buildings that need eviction, boarded-up properties, and houses with violations. We can close very fast if necessary, and we can deal with complicated situations (privacy, tenants, violations, etc.) We can help homeowners with short sale and foreclosure process, Estate sale, etc. We encourage property locators, Real Estate agents, and other developers who are willing to flip us buildings (for a price that still makes sense,) to contact us. We are willing to sign "time is of the essence, on or before" to assure seller we are ready, able, and willing to close, and we pay finder's fee. -Thank you for your attention.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Golden Buildings LLC[newLine][newLine]"

This is a nearly 1000 sq ft 2 bedroom 2 bath rent-stabilized apartment renting for $2195. You'll share the apartment with two other people. However, you'll pay quite a bit less than a third of the rent, as your room is a cozy 8 x 9 ft  "third" bedroom converted from a large alcove room that was previously a formal dining area, with a smartly designed curtain wall and central access to all the best features of the apartment--3 other large shared rooms--bath, eat-in kitchen and living room. The large bathroom, conveniently located to your right, is used by only 2 people and you can store your supplies there. With your tall curtain open, you can in fact enjoy the apartment's loft-like layout and use the huge living room as an extension of your living and working space. (Living Room is fully furnished, includes cable TV and another dining area.) It's your choice to use your space as a bedroom or just as a work space, should you have sleeping quarters elsewhere.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Furnished apartment with lots of windows--Share entire apartment, yet enjoy your own separate space with wood floors, a fire-escape window with blinds and a view out to the cool, leafy, breezy side of the building. There's a charming built-in arched set of shelves and vintage chest of drawers for storage, and room in a closet nearby for your coats. You can add a clothes rack if you wish. A single bed is included. One end of the room is a semi-circle--a cool architectural feature! There's 2 small bookcases, they can prop up a tabletop to make a simple desk. If you wish, an office chair, 2 lamps, night table and fan are also available. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Heat is included in the rent. Electric, Gas and Cable/WiFi bills must be split with other 2 residents; the 1/3 portion you use will come to about $75 per month. I cook a lot and keep a fully stocked kitchen. If you like to do the same we can work out sharing food storage, utensils, dishes and appliances.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]This 3rd-floor apartment is in a pleasant recently-renovated 1930's 7-story multi-unit brick building with newly replaced modern elevators. Not really wheelchair-accessible due to sunken-style lobby. On-site laundry/several outside laundromats. Several gyms in the neighborhood/other recreational facilities nearby, plus 3 parks: Juniper, Forest and Flushing Meadows. Picturesque residential parts of neighborhood make for lovely walking or jogging.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Apartment relatively quiet despite proximity to commercial area. Outside of keeping the noise level down late at night in respect to the neighbors, the walls are pretty thick and we've found that any of us playing TV and music late is fine... between us sound can always be muted/headphones worn if absolute quiet is needed. We like being able to have company over, but since most of the interior furnishings are those of myself, the original tenant, I naturally prefer that gatherings be on the small side and for you and guests to be respectful of the furniture.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]You must like, and not be allergic to, cats. As the leaseholder of this apartment for many years, I've let my several friendly felines occupy all its general areas--one recently passed away so currently I just have two cats--they are older and well-behaved and are not in the habit of scattering or knocking down anyone's items. They tend to hang out in my room most of the time and actually respect the other roommates' spaces even if rooms are left open. Since they are older, I don't wish to have them stressed with having to deal with a roommate's pet, so I cannot accept a roommate who is hoping to move in with a pet of his/her own. Yet it's a plus if you're an animal lover, my cats will surely return your affection! If you have any concerns about pet hair, I do vac all areas and supply lint rollers. Plus I can supply and regularly vac/launder "cat covers" for your bed or chair if you want. It is important that you too are neat and put away your clothes, that will keep my cats off them! Speaking of neatness, your space is centrally located and often will be visible to others so it must be kept presentable. In addition, we are all busy people and thus require that you do your share of the common household upkeep and cleaning. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]This room is available October 1st. First and last month's rent (security) required prior to move-in. Long-term rental is fine, with a minimum stay of 6 months. Two months notice if you're moving out.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]You must be reliable and mature. I'm female and prefer to room with working, non-smoking people. Be ready to provide checkable references, information about your job and recent W-2/pay stubs. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

You would be joining me, a 30s yr old lady who works full-time as a grant writer for a social justice nonprofit. I'm looking for a low-key, considerate roommate who is employed full-time outside of the house. Someone who will take initiative with chores and replacing shared household supplies. Above all, you value a tidy, harmonious home that is not a routine hotel for guests. I'm native to Brooklyn and have lived in this apartment for two+ years.  [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The building is a prewar, four-story walk up settled on a quiet block that is within feet of bustling Franklin Avenue, this 3-bedroom gem is the perfect place for a respite from the concrete jungle. The room boasts a spacious walk-in closet with four wide, built-in shelves and a smaller closet located just outside the room. The space can comfortably fit a full to queen-sized bed, dresser, bookcase, desk, and nightstand. Located in the rear of the apartment, this room does not share a wall with any of the other rooms. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The nearby Park Place shuttle is your easiest connection to Manhattan and the rest of Brooklyn, or take a 5-minute stroll up Franklin Ave. to grab the 2,3,4,5 trains. The close proximity of Eastern Parkway leads you down a short, picturesque walk to Brooklyn's natural and cultural hubs: The Brooklyn Museum, Botanic Garden, the Central Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, Grand Army Plaza (where an array of vendors set up a camp every Saturday for the Farmer's Market), and Prospect Park. The neighborhood also offers more than enough choices for cafés, restaurants, supermarkets, and laundromats (including a 24hr laundromat right up the block), and local bookstores. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Shared bills (electricity and WiFi) split three ways generally run under $65 each per month. You will need to make either 40x the rent or have a guarantor and good credit to qualify. One month's rent and a security deposit equivalent to one-month's rent required to move in. The lease application is handled directly through the landlord.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Prohibited: dogs, and couples or friends renting a single room. The rooms are for single occupancy only.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

price="$325000"
content="            [newLine][newLine]Located on a beautiful island in the Chesapeake Bay is a fabulous opportunity to own 2 parcels of land with Million Dollar Views and an a once in a lifetime business location. Gwynns Island is approximately 4 miles long off Mathews County. It is accessed by a recently rebuilt antique swing bridge and is surrounded by several bodies of water including the Chesapeake Bay and Milford Haven. Boaters, fisherman, kayakers and all water lovers find their happiness here![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The two lots total .55 acres and contain 2 cinder block building that were formally a fishing camp and a bait and tackle shop. Although they are only feet from the waters edge, a redevelopment plan has been approved by Mathews County to raze the existing buildings and rebuild in their footprint 2 much larger and more substantial buildings. The approved plan calls for each building to have 3 stories (two and a half stories with shed dormers) and a total of 6000 square feet. Each building is considered a single family residence and will have 6 bedrooms and 6 bathrooms. Since the local zoning allows for a BandB business, the buildings can be used as rental units for on and off season living. Considering that there is only one other BandB and no other hotels in the county, it has potential for a substantial income. Both first floors are designed as event space so hosting weddings and corporate meetings are all possible income generation. Other options include building 1 or 2 single family houses without a business included. Either way the views are fabulous! [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The current architectural style is going to be Craftsman Revival using a vertical board and batten design. I have included photos of my designs although the White House photos are most representative of my intentions. (3 levels instead of 2) [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The selling price is $325,000 for both parcels and it includes all of the engineering studies and plans that were used for the redevelopment approval, the current septic permits, the VDOT entrance permits, the current proposed floor plans and elevation drawings and all documents relating to the building of the new project. Septic easement is across the street and a well is already installed on site. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There is also the remnants of a dock and bulkhead which are all grandfathered for easy permitting and rebuilding.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The seller is a licensed Virginia Class A contractor and is available to assist in building the entire project from permitting to completed Certificate of Occupancy. The seller is also considering taking on an investor or a partner. Detailed cost estimates can be furnished to interested parties.[newLine][newLine]"

This corner house at 89 Palmer Street in Stamford, CT with a white picket fence, is a commuter's dream on a quiet, tree-lined, residential street that is a VERY SHORT WALK to the Springdale Metro North station. Check it out on the map and think about that for a sec - no driving to the station and all the expense that incurs (assuming you can even get a permit space  - the waitlist for Springdale can be many mths+), no digging your car out of the snow, scraping the windows and warming it up prior to having to commute - just a pleasant, safe, short, convenient walk passing convenience stores, bistros, after work bars and nightlife, kid care, dry cleaning etc...[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Old Springdale is a quiet residential area north of downtown Stamford with its own nightlife and "village" feel. Three, short, tree-lined, blocks (6-8 minute) to Springdale Metro North Train Station with a direct ride to and from to Grand Central during rush hours (~50 min to GCT and you'll almost always get a seat ;-) and an easy walk to pharmacies, dry-cleaning, banks, major regional USPS Post Office, Auto-body shop, NAPA Auto parts store, Wholesale fish market, FARMER'S MARKET, ice-skating rink, multiple Sports Clubs, Bobby Valentine's Sports Academy, Trampoline park, tanning salon, Zumba classes, EXCELLENT local library, restaurants, main run movie theater, art cinema, schools and many many more neighborhood amenities. The "Best Pizza" and "Best Italian Bakery" in Stamford are just down the hill. This house is not on the busy, loud main thoroughfare (Hope Street) packed with condos, loud neighbors and rumbling diesel belching buses and trucks, but on a quiet, tree lined, pleasant side street giving you easy, walkable access to all the businesses and amenities without the gritty urban downside.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]This SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE (not "townhouse" or "condo" with neighbors on either side of thin walls and cramped public spaces) has 3 bright, sun filled bedrooms and 2 full baths. There is a bright sun-room surrounded by a huge deck. Built in the 1895, it still has all the charm of a classic old colonial but has been freshly polished and refurbished. It has brand new Kitchen tile floors and brand new Bath tile floors (both). It has refinished wood floors throughout with beautiful dappled sunlight streaming through traditional 6 pane sash windows. It has a recently painted interior. There's an oil burning boiler that provides heat and endless hot water (as long as you have oil ;-). There is a full kitchen with GE Profile appliances. The stove is GAS BURNING (take note Chef's - not electric). There is a washer and dryer in your empty, huge WALK OUT basement (Previous tenants rode into and worked on their motorcycles in this basement). There is a FENCED IN backyard for your pets, with towering and flowering trees (an enormous Dogwood and a majestic King Crimson Maple) and a huge deck perfect for outdoor BBQ'ing in the summer. There is carport covered parking just for you, plus plenty of regular on-street parking. There are beautiful planted perennials all over, a terraced side yard with climbing roses and a huge hydrangea, another side yard with arbor vitae, forsythia, large hydrangea, aromatic lilacs, Rose of Sharon, pachysandra, and evergreens all over - plus a sunny space with lots of compost for you to try out your own green thumb if you wish. All general structure, appliance maintenance and major landscaping are included in the rent.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The immediate walkable area has lots of child friendly activities and stores - you won't have to drive to them -- Kids U, My Gym, a kids consignment store, etc. . . . There is local professional day-care conducive to commuting parent(s) - Bright Horizons and Building Blocks are extremely close, JCC and others are short drives. A pleasant neighborhood park is walkable just up the hill, with a pond, turtles, ducks and rabbits galore. The Weed Hill branch of the Ferguson library is a walkable local hidden gem with many activities and classes for kids of all ages. Zoned schools are - Springdale Elementary (easily walkable and the recently the recipient of several major educational awards), Dolan Middle School (a walk of about 15-20 minutes) and Stamford HS (a drive of about 5-10 minutes). There are also lotteries for the numerous excellent magnet school options in Stamford. Cove Island Park is always a draw in the summer and a boat slip and marina permit can be obtained from City Hall. An ice cream store in the local shopping district is a kid-favorite. There are art films and major releases at the theaters two blocks away. Residents walk to take advantage of all the activities and classes nearby -- Bobby Valentine's, a national gymnastics training center, Sacred Heart University extension *and* you can easily drive to the UCONN Business School, NCC, etc. . . It is a short easy drive to downtown Stamford, New Canaan, I-95 (exit #9 Glenbrook Road) or the Merritt Parkway (exit #36 Old Stamford Road). Hedge fund alley is on your doorstep and with the train to Stamford (UBS/RBS) and New York City mid-town a stone's throw away, the world is your "oyster" ;-)[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Administrivia -- Utilities, routine lawncare (e.g. grass/hedge trimming, weed removal), gutter/eave cleaning, leaf and snow/ice removal are the responsibility of the tenant and are not included in the rent.

They make you sign a fake "contract" that they use against you to not return your security deposit -- even if you follow every single of their 100+ rules. They find reasons to pry money from you any way they can. They'll ask for a deposit to hold a room for you and when you arrive, they'll tell you it's booked and not give you your money back. And you can't sue them in court or go to the cops because they don't tell you ANYTHING about themselves and the cops don't have jurisdiction.

We all have our quirks and that's what makes life and people interesting. I am a Real Estate Broker in Manhattan for the past 14 years (writing a movie about that...Haha) and also working on starting an industrial design biz.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]I went to College for design and had my own furniture business for 5 years after graduating. I was featured in 48 magazines, newspapers, etc. and intend to go back to design one day.  So I am creative, interested in arts, politics, industrial design of course, and spirituality (I go to Kabbalah with Madonna) - just a well rounded New Yorker I guess.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]Here's my lifestyle.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]Alarm goes off at 8:30am Mon- Friday. Hit snooze a few times and get on the computer promptly at 9:00 am while sucking down 2 cups of coffee. Shower, get dressed and out the door around 10:00am give or take 15 minutes.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]Then I'm running around town showing apartments, may run home for a conference call, and out the door again, etc. I do come home for lunch on occasion depending on the day.  Real Estate work wraps up around 6- 7pm depending on my clients - and stop off at the supermarket on my way home. Or I go play pool with some buddies at one of the local bars - get home around 9:30.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]I like to cook, but always clean up right afterwards.  (My only rule is no piled up dishes in the sink.)  Just for cleanliness (No bugs and don't want any) and also as common courtesy for the roommates. I'm usually in front of the tube at 11pm ( Daily show etc.) and turn in around 1am.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]I am single, but I'm not bringing home strangers or anything like that. (I do get lucky once in a while. LOL)  So I don't mind if you have a house guest as well but not a girlfriend/boyfriend spending 3 days at time in the apartment either. Just normal stuff I guess.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]I happen to be super clean but not a "freak" about it either.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]I have some friends who live in the neighborhood who stop by from time to time for a dinner or to watch a football game/Netflix etc. for a few hours here and there. Obviously if we live together we should just let each other know about visits - just common courtesy stuff. 420 and gay friendly, etc. I'm Totally laid back about stuff. Just not a dirty kitchen sink. Haha.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]The share will cost you $1200+ ½ the cable and electric. Figure about $100 - per month (Summer time electric bill is about $200 and $80 in winter. Which we split.)[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]Cable package is currently $165 per month including Road Runner and Wi-Fi, digital HD for Netflix  etc.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Apartment is fully furnished except bring your own mattress. The room has a desk, chest of drawers, A/C drapes on windows etc. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]So it will be $3600 to move in (First, last &amp; security deposit)[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]Please have a look at attached pics it was freshly painted.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]I smoke (And trying to quit) - so I only smoke out of an exhaust fan in living room only and with drapes between kitchen etc. ... To keep smoke limited to fan area and we have Fabreeze!!!!  So the apt doesn't and won't smell.  (Current roommate doesn't smoke and doesn't have any issues.)[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]Lastly it's a 5th floor walk-up - which sounds rough, but trust me... you will get used to very quickly.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]Let me know.[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]Best:[newLine][newLine] [newLine][newLine]"

We have over 25 years of experience and have a great reputation for being honest and fair. The corporation buys about 30-55 buildings a year, depending on the market situation. The condition of the property is almost irrelevant, as we buy all-cash, no inspection contingency. In many cases we don't need access just send us the building size, location, and asking price, and we will get back to you very soon. We can take occupied houses that need eviction, boarded-up properties, and buildings with violations. A closing can be scheduled if necessary in 3 days, and we can deal with complicated situations (privacy, tenants, violations, etc.) Property locators, Real Estate agents, and other developers who are willing to flip at a price that still makes sense are all welcome to contact us. We are willing to sign "time of the essence, on or before" to assure seller we are ready able and willing to close, and we pay finder's fee. -Thank you for your attention.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Golden Buildings LLC[newLine][newLine]"

(Income Requirements: $38,775 - $47,000 (min. annual salary); Max. move-in costs for this room is $3,525)[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]If you are seeking double-occupancy for you and a partner (or minor) unfortunately we are unable to accommodate you.  Double-occupancy (e.g. couples) places too much of a burden/hardship on the shared household resources.  For this reason, we are only considering single-occupancy of the furnished bedrooms (meaning no more than 4 flatmates during tenancy).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]First and last month's rent, plus one (1) month security deposit for all listed vacancies are required and non-negotiable (the first and last month rent are prorated as a courtesy).  Credit, housing and criminal background checks required for all prospective tenants (there is a one-time, non-refundable, application fee associated with the background check).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]To be considered a potential candidate:[newLine][newLine]a. You must be enrolled, or have recently accepted enrollment, in an accredited educational institution such as an undergraduate/graduate program, vocational/trade school, or are independently studying for professional certificate(s), certification(s) and/or license(s) such as The United States Medical Licensure Exam (USMLE), the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX), a "Bar Exam," etc.; or[newLine][newLine]b. You recently accepted, or have less than 3 years of employment, in an entry-level position; and[newLine][newLine]c. Your annual salary at a minimum is 33x the desired monthly rent (for actively enrolled undergraduate/graduate/vocational students), or 40x the desired monthly rent (for entry-level professionals); and[newLine][newLine]d. Your FICO credit score is above 674 (exceptions at landlord's discretion, no credit history permissible); and[newLine][newLine]e. You are ready and willing to discuss who you are and why you think you may be a good fit (such as: What you do for a living, if you are a smoker (e.g. cigarettes, marijuana, hookah), your current living situation, why you are looking to change it, how soon that change is foreseen, your experiences with overnight guests, overnight dishes, cooking, cleanliness, sharing, boundaries, etc.).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]bi·o / ˈbīō/  Since 1999 I have spearheaded a community effort by providing affordable housing to students and entry-level professionals willing to consider housing outside of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.  I am NOT an employee of the landlord, I am NOT a real estate person, NOR do I work on commission.  I do however occupy the premises and volunteer my time facilitating communications and repairs within the property.  I work full-time as a public servant in the engineering field so my time is limited (ergo, serious inquiries only).  I am invested, professional and responsive and ask for all potential renters to reciprocate in kind.  I pride myself on being transparent, an innate problem-solver and a straight-shooter.  Should you be financially, physically or mentally unstable I am NOT qualified to pursue a relationship with you much less one that yields a long-term communal housing situation.  We are only pursuing good fits and do not require full occupancy.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Actively seeking to establish and maintain a communal household comprised of driven individuals trying to educationally and/or professionally elevate themselves within the NYC metropolitan area.  If you are opposed to occasionally sharing household meals, group activities, or are unable to comply with NYC Department of Sanitation's recycling ordinances then chances are we are NOT compatible.  Recycling is of the upmost importance in this household so if you are into a green way of living i.e. recycling beyond NYC ordinances, composting, sustainability efforts, healthy eating, up-cycling, etc., we NEED your camaraderie.  Although we understand the shared situations are not for everyone, we have been trying to provide an alternative platform that can allot for a positive communal experience and promulgate further success within the community.  Our goal is to establish a household best described as driven, educated, preferably recently employed and/or actively enrolled in a vocational/higher education institution (i.e. undergrad/grad/trades school) but most importantly a stress-free environment.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]neigh·bor·hood /ˈnābərˌho͝od/  Despite being an up-and-coming area, the Bronx has not been able to rid itself of its bad reputation (acquired during the large exodus by the Jewish community in the 1970s).  You are encouraged to research the surrounding area but if you are white, black, yellow, tangerine, etc. chances of you being a victim of a violent crime are slim (although Manhattan can catch you off-guard with its cramped overpriced quarters and susceptibility to random acts of terrorism/aging infrastructure failures).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]North of Yankee Stadium, nestled within a hilly enclave of Art Deco apartment complexes, Tudor and Victorian homes, Morrisania is an affordable NYC corridor with a quiet community-oriented vibe.  With plenty of places to connect with neighbors, there are multiple weekly green markets, a handful of dance and yoga studios, as well as friendly bodegas, hair salons and delis.  The recently reopened historic High Bridge, which connects Washington Heights and the Highbridge neighborhood in the Bronx, offers an easy pedestrian and bicycle route to upper Manhattan.  In addition, the new Harlem River Greenway, along 20 acres of the Harlem River waterfront, has waterfront parkland that connects pedestrian walk ways, bicycling access, and jogging trails which really has given this area a long needed facelift and restored the community's historic access to the waterfront.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]spe·cif·ics /spəˈsifiks/  The home is located on a quiet tree-lined street that is predominantly populated with 2- and 3-family dwellings and a cluster of rent-stabilized apartment buildings at its core.  Our biggest short-coming is the lack of venues for take-out/dining-in.  Although, Hungry Bird (a quaint neighborhood restaurant serving Indian cuisine) and Justine's (another neighboring restaurant serving Dominican cuisine) are within walking distance.  More importantly, deliveries for your avid Grubhub and Seamless user are available.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]ad·ver·tise·ment /ˈadvərˌtīzmənt/ Two (2) housemate openings available in a furnished 2nd Floor, 4-Bedroom/1-Bath, co-ed apartment-share (asking $975/mo. and $1,175/mo., single-occupancy only).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]dis·clo·sure / disˈklōZHər/ You will need to schedule a viewing of the premise in order to get the ball rolling (bring a friend since you will be visiting a stranger's home).  Next, you will need to meet the members of the household as to assess if we are a good fit.  After we meet and iron out any mutual concerns we can then move onto the next step, i.e. the application process.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Viewing the premises does not incur a fee but interested applicants are encouraged, contingent on our compatibility, to complete a lease application after the viewing.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]There is a single $75.00 application fee per applicant (which includes a $36.98 amount that would be directly payable via credit card to E-Renter.com) and this one application fee allows you to apply for any or all of the vacancies at the time of the application process.  Submissions of incomplete lease applications will NOT be considered.  During the application process the room you are interested in will be removed from the market and placed on hold (for a maximum of 48 hours).  However, if your annual salary is NOT equal to or greater than 33x-40x one month's rent then hold on to both your cash and personal information.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Upon successful completion of the application process a move-in date is set at which time the first and last month's rent plus one (1) month security deposit will be required (move-in dates must be established within five (5) calendar days after completion of the application process).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]con·clu·sion /kənˈklo͞oZHən/ To be considered a potential candidate you MUST meet the requirements disclosed above in addition to being considerate, clean, smoke-free, ethical, independent, laid-back and resourceful[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Also, seeking a skilled trades-person (i.e. experienced property manager/superintendent, carpenter, electrician, plumber, etc.) for paid/barter situation yielding an additional source of income for prospective housemate(s): general home improvement - $20-$40 per hour (contingent on project and skill aptitude).

The property is at the end of the paved part of the street, with only one neighbor on the opposite side.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Nicely located within 20 - 30 minutes drive from renowned shopping at Woodbury Commons, four season activities of Harriman Park, the Catskills and various Hudson River attractions.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]This is a fully conforming lot for building under the local Town code. Zoned "R-20/40", its primary construction area is the northernmost 90-100 feet (facing same direction as width of a house on Ingalls Street), with a 30 foot wide by about 120 feet long swale or rainwater runoff area, in its southern 200 feet by 101 feet portion. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]This area can become a private pond, with some appropriate landscaping. Imagine having an in-ground infinity pool overlooking your own private pond, to extend the water view! Please note, the parcel has no DEC or other restrictions that might block construction of a house and garage, shed, etc. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]* - note: address number is estimated, actual number is assigned upon permit application[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Please see the photo descriptions for some more specific details and to make sure you have more complete and useful information.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]1.

This is taken from the official County viewer.[newLine][newLine]7. Looking North, about 40 feet from its N border. Remnant of old shed type building foundation is seen at the middle right edge of this picture.[newLine][newLine]8. This area can become a beautiful private pond! View of southern swale-type area that gathers rainwater at times. Has no effect on 'buildable' area of the property, and there are no "wetland" issues (there's no DEC or Fed, NWI designation).[newLine][newLine]9. Zoning map of a part of the Town of Wappinger, along with most of the Village of Wappingers Falls. The property is highlighted in orange (look a little above and to the right of the red "20/40" Zone label, on the map).

title="A Better Way of Life"
type="article"
content="I felt like I was a human hamster going round and round the wheel.  Year after year feeling like I was caught in some type of one track mind; sort of like in the Ground Hog Day movie.  I am a single mom who worked only to provide a roof for myself and take care of my son which is all that matter most to me.  Then one day, I figured out how I could have something to show for all my hard work and meet one of my goals.  Home ownership!  This is what I did to accomplish that. I bought a house outside of New York for under $25k utilizing my New York income.  The house needs a lot of work but I own it free and clear.  Now, if you want to know exactly how I did it, call me or send me a message when you are able to talk.  I want to help other people become homeowners like myself.  I finally don't feel like I'm in a Ground Hog Day nightmare, I feel like I'm in the Empire TV show building my empire one brick at a time on my terms.  Eventually, I will buy a property in New York, utilizing my out of state property's income.  Who wants to be a Millionaire in 4 years?  Real estate is the way to go.  Own outright, do it in a few years not 15, not 20 or 30 years (I did it in 1 year).  Make the call, have the conversation about your goals, even if you do not have the money yet, let's do it together.  Sharon  [newLine][newLine]"

A short ride to Manhattan and only a short walk to the amazing Prospect Park to barbecue, run, cycle, skate, or a couple stops to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. Come stay in a suburban oasis that lets you relax after crowded days in the urban jungle of Manhattan. Stroll through Victorian house-lined streets and greet your neighbors as you walk to plenty of award-winning local restaurants (See Yelp Reviews for The Farm on Adderly, Hunger Pang, Wheated, and more for Cortelyou Road and Church Avenue.) Within 5 minutes is a natural food store and two blocks away is a Co-op open to the public (no membership required.) Nearby is a wonderful yoga studio, plenty of churches/temples, and a great family-friendly vibe. PLENTY of street parking makes this a perfect place for those with a car.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The apartment is fully furnished with a fully functioning kitchen (fridge, gas range, cooking items, toaster, etc.), a clean and well-lit bathroom, and bedroom with full-sized Swedish mattress-topped bed*, and plenty of closet space to hang your clothing. Bathroom includes a separate bathtub and shower stall. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Coin-operated laundry is in the basement or treat yourself to laundry service up on Church Avenue. As you can see from the pictures, the apartment is wood-floored, light, and airy with a minimalist design.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]*The mattress and boxspring for the bed is on the floor because we live there with our very young children at times.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The rental fee includes A/C (one in living room, one in bedroom) and the $1750 includes Wi-Fi, water, gas, electric, etc.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]No smoking, drugs, pets, or serious partying please. Please respect our neighbors.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Only a short walk to Church Avenue Station (B/Q-line) allows you to be in Manhattan in 25 (Chinatown) to 30 (Union Square) minutes. The B/Q line gives you great access to all the best parts of the city. The 2/5 and F/G trains are a good 15-minute walk away if you need access to another train but most lines are accessible through Atlantic Avenue (including LIRR) 10-15 minutes north by train.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]This area can become a private pond, with some appropriate landscaping.

There's central air conditioning, a full sized washer dryer, a Bosch dishwasher, Toto dual flush toilets, Kohler bathroom fixtures, professional series five burner range, 65 inch smart tv and top of the line washer and dryer. There's ample street parking and incredible outdoor space-- both a beautiful patio with a river view and side and rear gardens. The center of Old Village Ossining in a couple of blocks away. There you'll find new bars, cafes and restaurants like Sing Sing Kill Brewery, Melike, and First Village Coffee. It's about a 9 minute walk to the train station where you can grab the Metro North for a 45 minute ride to Grand Central (less of course if you're heading to points north of there.) The rent includes weekly housekeeping of the common areas and wifi-- roommates split gas and electric 4 ways. You're really not going to see anything else like this for rent...ever.  Take a look at the photos and give me shout. Please tell me a bit about yourself in your reply.

Another single mother in the same boat would be ideal, though you don't have to be one to reply (you just need to be OK with living with a young child). I have not signed a lease yet because I need to find a roommate first to co-sign with me (cannot afford to live on my own).  Again, to be clear, my goal with this ad is to find a great roommate (preferably another single mom) with a similar budget, and then we can search for an apartment we like together later.  Roommate first, apartment second. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]That said, I actually did find an apartment I like in Sheepshead Bay that is still available, but have also seen others that would be suitable as well. Would prefer to find something within a 20-minute drive from the South Slope, but am open to Brooklyn locations outside of that. I can go as high as $1,000 (meaning $2000/mo. rent split two ways), but would prefer to keep it to under $900 ($1,800/mo.). The father of my son will guarantee my share of the rent (he has outstanding credit); please be creditworthy as well if you respond.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

content="Single 42 yo needs a room for rent. Can be furnished or unfurnished. No credit check please. Not gonna happen.. I work steady for three years and prior was 16 years at the same place...and I can provide source of my weekly income. Reason no credit check is I had a great job for 16 years and they did a reduction in force and I was laid off, thus struggled to find work and made a choice to pay my rent and eat instead of paying cards off. That is the reason. Not because I’m a low life. I don’t smoke I have bad asthma. I don’t cook if I do it’s rarely. I leave the house 5am Monday through Friday returning 5pm approximately. I’m usually home weekends and I don’t go out much and I don’t party. Me having a place to sleep is my party :) [newLine][newLine]Reason why I need a place is I currently rent a huge one bedroom apartment in Belle Harbor..have my own parking space and all is included, including cable and I have my own heating thermostat ... when I first moved in, my rent was $925...I have been here for four years and raising my rent every single year. The first year she raised my rent $225 a month..no joke. She also rents the two parking spaces in front of me. I’m very quiet and I pay for my rent every two weeks and I get paid weekly if that is better for you. I just need a break and I can’t seem to get ahead with her unreasonable rent increases. [newLine][newLine]Please feel free to email me or text me...if you call me, I may not hear the phone, but leave a message and I’ll call you back. I just wanted to add to this since I said I have bad asthma, I can’t be around any animals at all because it will send me to the hospital [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Thanks for your time.[newLine][newLine]"

content="Hi there,[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Please read very carefully: I'm a part time Grad student/professional in my early 30s who is seeking a furnished room to rent ONLY in Eastchester, Woodlawn, &amp; Yonkers, or South Orange and West Orange, New Jersey. I prefer to rent a room out of a single-family house. I'm single and don't have kids or pets. I don't smoke or use drugs. I'm seeking roommates who are honest, kind, mature, non-dramatic, respectful and very clean. I would like to move in right away. IF YOU ARE NOT RENTING A ROOM IN THE TOWNS I LISTED THEN DO NOT RESPOND, SERIOUSLY. I REPEAT, DON’T CONTACT ME IF YOU’RE NOT RENTING IN THE LISTED COMMUNITIES. Another thing, I've lately dealt with several unprofessional and inconsiderate individuals who have cancelled my scheduled appointments for a room viewing at short notice. If you want to play games then play with yourself, but don't waste my time! Thank you in advance.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Regards,[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

It has a single window facing a quiet side street. Also, it has an exceptionally cavernous closet. We share a 4-bedroom spanning the whole top floor of a 3-story brick townhouse. The living room is sprawling, and has a skylight. We also have rooftop access, laundry on our block, and bike storage.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Where: Located on the corner of 5th Ave and 6th St in Park Slope proper we neighbor an especially great group of restaurants, bakeries, and cafes. Just a 6 minute walk to the "4th Ave - 9th St." subway stop (F, G, R trains), and a 10 minute walk to Prospect Park, Whole Foods, the new Nighthawk Cinema, and the Park Slope Food co-op.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Us: We are very quiet, kind, easy-going, and mindful of the way we use the space, taking care to keep it peaceful and relaxing for all–– a real sanctuary. We try to give one another space and privacy mainly, and are not involved in any deep sense in one another's social lives –– but at the same time there is a palpable feeling of admiration, trust, and respect between us. Sometimes we share details from our lives but we are also comfortable moving around the kitchen without feeling pressure to engage, which is nice. Also, we care a good deal about keeping the place clean, and each do our parts to assure that it will be. I'm Kristi and I recently finished a PhD program, working now on a few articles for publication. Maelenn is a Budget Analyst for the city. Lindsay (who is male) is a writer/waiter. The bookshelves are brimming and there are lots of plants. Lindsay is 37, Maelenn is 26, and I'm 38.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]YOU: We are looking for someone exceptionally good at thinking about how her/his actions might bear upon others. What this means practically is having true self-awareness AND roommate-awareness. If you find it difficult to imagine the perspective of others, if you generally prefer to do your own thing without regard for its impact on others and tend to react with surprise and irritation when others fail to conform to you and your habits, you will not be happy here. Also, if you are someone who tends towards defensiveness or passive aggression and who is unable to think critically about the bigger picture, you're also going to have a hard time. The dynamic here has been pretty utopian with everyone getting along really well, without drama, tension, bitterness, and this is something we want to preserve. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]One rule we all abide: doing dishes right away–– and never leaving anything in the sink for later. Fine to leave dirty plates in your own room but not in the sink or around the kitchen. We want someone who is wholly on board with this.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]We're looking for someone to commit for long term meaning at least a year but might consider someone shorter term too.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Unique family owned and managed townhouse centrally located on a a beautiful tree-lined residential block two blocks to Central Park. East 62nd Street between Park and Lexington Avenue is a premier location on the Upper East Side and close to mid-town manhattan. The elegant brownstone offers furnished rental apartments with a sophisticated aesthetic of Shabby chic and Ralph Lauren. Theres nothing like it in New York City. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The house is set amid Manhattans most elegant and exclusive neighborhoods. Bloomingdales, Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman and Madison Avenues chic boutiques, restaurants and cafes are just a few blocks away. Neighborhood antique shops, galleries, specialty stores and world-renowned museums are within walking distance. Access to public transportation is phenomenal. The F &amp; Q subway lines are located one block way on 63rd Street. The N, R, 4, 5 &amp; 6 subway lines are two blocks from the house on 60th Street. We offer flexible leasing terms with a minimum 30-91 days. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Amenities include Air Conditioning, Cable/TV/ROKU for streaming, Decorative Fireplace, Internet.

There is no elevator.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Amenities include: a/c, cable, TV &amp; ROKU. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]About the Suite: A flight up from the lobby, on the parlor floor, one can find the Garden Room suite. The visitor is immediately transfixed by the massive floor-to-ceiling bow window which takes up most of the Southern wall of the suite. This suite also includes a private 500 square garden terrace, a truly rare-find for affordable New York City accommodations. The expansive, verdant cedar roof deck plays host to any number of roses, lavender, and other plants, with jardinieres and wooden planters framing the deck furniture: a breezy teak bench, three lazy steamer lounge chairs, and a 9 umbrella. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Though some will no doubt want to spend much of their time on the terrace, the Garden Room itself makes for no ordinary place to return to for the night or the afternoon rest. Soaring, nearly 12-foot ceilings look down on this quiet room and its carved wood and marble fireplace mantle, tall Normandy armoire, unique four-poster queen bed, and mahogany Philadelphia breakfast table. Another period throwback can be found in the southeast corner: a sculptured ceramic washbasin with wooden cabinet, augmenting the handbasin found in the bathroom.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Please note that there is no kitchen or access to a kitchen in the apartment. Provided is a small fridge, electric kettle, and sink in the room. The bathroom is a fully tiled, narrow space with antique style brass hardware and a merged shower and toilet area.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

I have not signed a lease yet because I need to find a roommate first to co-sign with me (cannot afford to live on my own).

Roommate first, apartment second.

Would prefer to find something within a 20-minute drive from the South Slope, but am open to Brooklyn locations outside of that. I can go as high as $1,000 (meaning $2000/mo. rent split two ways), but would prefer to keep it to under $900 ($1,800/mo.).

A short ride to Manhattan and only a short walk to the amazing Prospect Park to barbecue, run, cycle, skate, or a couple stops to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. Come stay in a suburban oasis that lets you relax after crowded days in the urban jungle of Manhattan. Stroll through Victorian house-lined streets and greet your neighbors as you walk to plenty of award-winning local restaurants (See Yelp Reviews for The Farm on Adderly, Hunger Pang, Wheated, and more for Cortelyou Road and Church Avenue.) Within 5 minutes is a natural food store and two blocks away is a Co-op open to the public (no membership required.) Nearby is a wonderful yoga studio, plenty of churches/temples, and a great family-friendly vibe. PLENTY of street parking makes this a perfect place for those with a car.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The apartment is fully furnished with a fully functioning kitchen (fridge, gas range, cooking items, toaster, etc.), a clean and well-lit bathroom, and bedroom with full-sized Swedish mattress-topped bed*, and plenty of closet space to hang your clothing. Bathroom includes a separate bathtub and shower stall. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Coin-operated laundry is in the basement or treat yourself to laundry service up on Church Avenue. As you can see from the pictures, the apartment is wood-floored, light, and airy with a minimalist design.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]*The mattress and boxspring for the bed is on the floor because we live there with our very young children at times.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The rental fee includes A/C (one in living room, one in bedroom) and the $1750 includes Wi-Fi, water, gas, electric, etc.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]No smoking, drugs, pets, or serious partying please. Please respect our neighbors.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Only a short walk to Church Avenue Station (B/Q-line) allows you to be in Manhattan in 25 (Chinatown) to 30 (Union Square) minutes. The B/Q line gives you great access to all the best parts of the city. The 2/5 and F/G trains are a good 15-minute walk away if you need access to another train but most lines are accessible through Atlantic Avenue (including LIRR) 10-15 minutes north by train.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

type="article"
content="I am transitioning into a new position, possibly out of state and I am looking to rent a room for 3-6 months. Currently, I live in Westchester county renting from the same landlord for over 7 years. I have a clean background check, clean rental history and decent credit. I can afford up to $850 per month and I'd prefer a month-to-month lease and would give a 30+ day notice when I'd need to end the rental. I am looking to move-in around 10/15/2019 or no later than the end of October. I am 40+, African American, single, no little kids, I have a car and I'm a clean/quiet person. I'd prefer a shared living situation with a private bathroom BUT I'm open to whatever is available, clean, SAFE and decent. I have been with the same employers for 7 years so I can provide W-2/paystubs, etc. If you have a rental situation that fits what I am seeking please contact me via email to discuss in  details.

Rent is $1750/month due on the 30th/31st of previous month. To secure the room, first and last month's rent are required in addition to a one-month security deposit of $1,750. The rental term is flexible and will be month-to-month, but preference is given to a longer term applicants. **This listing is for a single individual tenant only** So sorry -- no couples. Sadly, pets are not permitted :( [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The 405 square foot room has a built-in lofted bed platform, which can accommodate a Queen size mattress.  There's also plenty of room to set up a bed on the floor and use the loft for storage.  In the past, this room has been used residentially as an artist-in-residence live/work space, a film editing suite, and an art studio. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The room is private, but the kitchen and bathroom are shared residentially with 3 other creative professionals (two woman and one man - graphic design, feature film, literature) and a 7 year-old girl in 2nd grade. We are all very friendly people, but we also enjoy and respect each other's individual privacy. Living here is almost like living alone, except for the occasional kitchen overlap in the morning or evening. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]We're looking for someone mature, quiet, clean, who has a day job outside of the home, and who doesn't cook. We're not trying to stifle anyone's culinary ambitions, but the reality of life at this loft is that the kitchen gets regular use preparing meals for the 7 year-old, which includes breakfast, lunch and dinner. We don't want you to be disappointed if the stove is frequently occupied, so this loft is a better fit for someone who doesn't cook. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The couple with the child are out of town many weekends, and often for full weeks at a time. The loft is frequently empty and quiet.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]We split the monthly utility bills four ways, so you'll be responsible for 1/4. This includes electricity, heat, hot water and internet.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Absolutely no smoking allowed in the building.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The building has a large freight elevator and is located steps from Vanderbilt Ave. (restaurants, bars, laundry, groceries), BAM, 7th ave B/Q train, Bergen St 2/3 and the Atlantic/Pacific Ave subway stop/ LIRR terminal (2,3,4,5,Q,B,N,R,D), the Clinton/Washington C and the Fulton G stations. Walk to prospect park, Brooklyn Museum, Barclay's Center, Target Center, or the Brooklyn Public Library in 5-10 minutes. Fort Greene and Park Slope are a ten minute walk away. It's the best residential neighborhood in Brooklyn![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine] The photos posted here show the room furnished as it was on two separate occasions to give you a sense of some possibilities.  The room will be empty upon move-in.  If you are interested, please email us at the link provided and tell a little about yourself. We can set up a time for you to come by, check the place out.[newLine][newLine]"

content="Hello,[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I'm looking for a quiet true 1 bedroom apartment similar to my 1.5 bedroom floor-through Fort Greene brownstone pictured.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Please no shares/roomates or sublets, unless landlord approved lease-takeover. 🙏🏽[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Currently paying $2k w/ utilities included, may have some flexibility for the right space, must be under $2500.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I prefer to rent direct from the landlord.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Open to working with a broker that has direct connects to apts in the neighborhood before they hit the market. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Really trying to stay in Fort Greene and surrounding, I have been living in this community forever and can't imagine being anywhere else. I've been looking for almost a year to try to stay in the community, it is very dear to me, I've been here a decade. Waiting to find the right long-term home. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]All criteria are flexible of course for the perfect space.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Ideally looking for a floor-through space in another brownstone / small pre-war building: [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]- Top/upper floor (please no ground / garden or parlor floors).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]- Lots of light (I have a lot of plants). [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]- With enough space to put a large desk / tiny studio (alcoves are perfect!) as I work from home about 50% of the time. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]- Love old details and charm! [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]- Closer to the A/C Lafayette / Clinton Washington + Atlantic Terminal ideally.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Quiet, lots of light, and subway proximity are my biggest priorities.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I'm a single, gainfully employed creative freelancer, in my mid-thirties, non-smoker with no pets. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I am exceptionally quiet and considerate (I don't wear shoes in the house, slam doors or play loud music, my neighbors never hear me). I've very private but like to know my neighbors.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I'm super responsible, have excellent credit, and clean. I also carry renter's insurance.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Additionally, I would love to offer design/updating/renovation for your space if needed, as it's the nature of my work. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I care and invest greatly in my living space, it's my sanctuary.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I truly am an ideal and excellent tenant.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I don't have a set move date (ideally by September), I will wait for the right space but am somewhat urgently looking. I am now floating around in sublets as my previous space was making me sick due to mold, carbon monoxide and water issues in the building. This is the only reason I'm leaving my apartment. I've invested a lot into my current home and will be leaving this space in infinitely better condition than when I moved in. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Really looking for another very special gem to be a forever home, I'm being a bit particular as my current home is pretty magic minus the toxins. All criteria are flexible of course for the perfect space.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]For more insight into my lifestyle: [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]https://www.instagram.com/youonlyseewithyoureyes[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Please contact directly via email with information about your available space. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Serious messages only please, I will not make appointments to see spaces with no details / photos / links. I'm very conscious of wasting anyone's time.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Thank you![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]This will stay up until I find my new home.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]"

This ad concerns the largest bedroom. The room will be unfurnished and available for an immediate move-in.  You would be joining me, a 30s yr old lady who works full-time as a grant writer for a social justice nonprofit. I'm looking for a low-key, considerate roommate who is employed full-time outside of the house. Someone who will take initiative with chores and replacing shared household supplies. Above all, you value a tidy, harmonious home that is not a routine hotel for guests. I'm native to Brooklyn and have lived in this apartment for two+ years. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The building is a prewar, four-story walk-up settled on a quiet block that is within feet of bustling Franklin Avenue, this 3-bedroom gem is the perfect place for a respite from the concrete jungle. This generously sized bedroom has a decorative fireplace with a colorful tile mosaic at the base. It lacks a closet, but it's spacious enough to accommodate a queen- or king-sized bed, dresser, desk, nightstand and more with plenty room to spare. The room is always well-lit thanks to the bay window area. And, it's completely separated from the other two bedrooms, which are evenly spaced from each other as well. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The nearby Park Place shuttle is your easiest connection to Manhattan and the rest of Brooklyn, or take a 5-minute stroll up Franklin Ave. to grab the 2,3,4,5 trains. The close proximity of Eastern Parkway leads you down a short, picturesque walk to Brooklyn's natural and cultural hubs: The Brooklyn Museum, Botanic Garden, the Central Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, Grand Army Plaza (where an array of vendors set up camp every Saturday for the Farmer's Market), and Prospect Park. The neighborhood also offers more than enough choices for cafés, restaurants, supermarkets, and laundromats (including a 24hr laundromat right up the block), and local bookstores. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Shared bills (electricity and WiFi) split three ways generally run under $65 each per month. You will need to make either 40x the rent or have a guarantor and good credit to qualify. One month's rent and a security deposit equivalent to one-month's rent required to move in. The lease application is handled directly through the landlord.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Prohibited: dogs, and couples or friends renting a single room. The rooms are for single occupancy only.[newLine][newLine]"

The elegant brownstone offers furnished rental apartments with a sophisticated aesthetic of Shabby chic and Ralph Lauren. Theres nothing like it in New York City. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The house is set amid Manhattans most elegant and exclusive neighborhoods. Bloomingdales, Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman and Madison Avenues chic boutiques, restaurants and cafes are just a few blocks away. Neighborhood antique shops, galleries, specialty stores and world-renowned museums are within walking distance. Access to public transportation is phenomenal. The F &amp; Q subway lines are located one block way on 63rd Street. The N, R, 4, 5 &amp; 6 subway lines are two blocks from the house on 60th Street.

[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]About the Suite: A flight up from the lobby, on the parlor floor, one can find the Garden Room suite. The visitor is immediately transfixed by the massive floor-to-ceiling bow window which takes up most of the Southern wall of the suite. This suite also includes a private 500 square garden terrace, a truly rare-find for affordable New York City accommodations. The expansive, verdant cedar roof deck plays host to any number of roses, lavender, and other plants, with jardinieres and wooden planters framing the deck furniture: a breezy teak bench, three lazy steamer lounge chairs, and a 9 umbrella. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Though some will no doubt want to spend much of their time on the terrace, the Garden Room itself makes for no ordinary place to return to for the night or the afternoon rest. Soaring, nearly 12-foot ceilings look down on this quiet room and its carved wood and marble fireplace mantle, tall Normandy armoire, unique four-poster queen bed, and mahogany Philadelphia breakfast table. Another period throwback can be found in the southeast corner: a sculptured ceramic washbasin with wooden cabinet, augmenting the handbasin found in the bathroom.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Please note that there is no kitchen or access to a kitchen in the apartment. Provided is a small fridge, electric kettle, and sink in the room. The bathroom is a fully tiled, narrow space with antique style brass hardware and a merged shower and toilet area.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Furnished Short Term Rental Apartments, Extended-Stay, Corporate Housing.

Living here will introduce you to some of the most interesting and well-traveled creative dreamers and challenge you to develop a new appreciation for the DIY family as most of the lofts in this building are work/live studios![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]This space is ideal for freelancers, students, entrepreneurs, and even professionals who are traveling through NYC for a few months and need a place to plug right into work. Think seasonal and contract work. I keep the space extremely clean, lean, and efficient for this purpose. Most of our guests stay between 3-6 months. All our guests are typically between the ages 22 to 35. Over the years, alumni come visit as seasonal regular guests too. (We love them as though they are with us year round!). We are flexible, just talk to me! ^_^[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]My two good friends Rachel &amp; Hans and I have personally designed and managed this unit as a shared home especially for freelancers! Due to sound constraints, we have been primarily suited to writers, programmers, models, actors, digital arts, illustrators, film editors, and fitness/aerial arts (we have a weight training and cycling fitness gym, pool, and sauna onsite, and an aerial gym 3 blocks away called The Muse). Usually at least one of our guests is a really good chef. A few bi-coastal film/tv producers have made this place their seasonal nest. Most guests have spent significant time abroad. We love Third-culture kids.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Cost: Every private room is $1700/month, with all utilities and amenities included.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]**Key Features: [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]- The loft has 6 single-occupancy-only bedrooms / 2 Full Bathrooms (one with shower, the other with a bathtub)[newLine][newLine]-All Rooms have very quiet wall mounted Air Conditioning/Dehumidifying and Heating combination units, individually controlled![newLine][newLine]-  Beautiful hardwood floors[newLine][newLine]- All room have windows that get excellent natural lighting [newLine][newLine]- Extra height ceiling spaces, skylights[newLine][newLine]- 20-minute commute to Manhattan[newLine][newLine]- Continuously furnished and designed by art director and prop stylist Rachel Hornaday; See her work here: [newLine][newLine]http://rachelhornaday.com/[newLine][newLine]https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/brooklyn-tour-a-multi-media-artists-plant-filled-loft-257433[newLine][newLine]- Beautiful natural lighting throughout the loft; dimmable color lighting throughout the space[newLine][newLine]- Fully stocked kitchenware[newLine][newLine]- Laundry card, Washer/Dryer shared (in our building, on the same floor)[newLine][newLine]- Fitness Gym (open 24/7) , Sauna (incredible for the winter months, also open 24/7), Indoor lap pool (Open evenings daily) *SEE PHOTOS!*[newLine][newLine]- Rooftop Deck with shared BBQ grills (also open 24/7 to residents &amp; guests only)[newLine][newLine]- Meticulous deep cleaning of all common spaces multiple times a week by yours truly![newLine][newLine]- All utilities are included [newLine][newLine]- Weekly community events on the roof (BBQ, movie screenings, musician showcases, etc)[newLine][newLine]- No Pets and No Couples (All private bedrooms are single occupancy only!)[newLine][newLine]- Yes the pictures are real! Our space feels like a serviced apartment / boutique hotel because I am extremely tidy &amp; organized and I make sure the space stays that way all the time![newLine][newLine]- Beautiful Highland Park is less than 30min walk away, with very gorgeous walking and bike paths! You can also play tennis, soccer, and basketball![newLine][newLine]- I love yoga so I always have extra yoga equipment for everyone to use, plus we have an aerial gym a few blocks away called The Muse if you want to take classes in yoga or fitness circus training![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]**The Neighborhood:[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Located in the heart of a growing creative and artsy neighborhood. The street art scene is world renowned. The live music scene is equally famous. There are more vintage thrift stores and flea markets here than the rest of NYC because we do our best to recycle and reupholster. Urban farming is covering our warehouse roofs. This truly is a neighborhood of DIYers. You will not be disappointed if you are coming to NYC to explore and engage with a dynamic, eco-conscious, and arts-focused community. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]The streets are overflowing with breweries, pubs, galleries, art studios, film studios, tattoo parlors, artisanal coffee, and live music venues. All the best vintage thrift stores in NYC are right here. The largest open air warehouse nightclub in North America is 10 minutes away. Some of the best DJs in the world play 3 blocks away at a venue called Nowadays even on weeknights. One of the oldest underground collectives still throws events at a secret basement in a bar nearby. Some of the best of hispanic food restaurants in the city is just a few blocks away on Myrtle Avenue. One of the highest ranked gourmet pizza restaurants in all of NYC, Houdini's, is just around the corner. We have a warehouse brewery with a massive beer hall/concert venue 2 blocks away called Queens Brewery with karaoke and trivia nights. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Centrally located, both airports JFK and Laguardia are 20 minutes away. The gorgeous beaches along Long Island are only 30 minutes away. But at the same time we are only 30 minutes from the Empire State Building. This neighborhood is immediately next to Queens, which is the most diverse place on Earth in terms of languages spoken, and has all the most authentic East and South Asian food in all of NYC. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]In short, world class international artists in NYC live and work in our neighborhood, mixed happily with the hispanic families that have been here for decades. For home cooked food, you can buy groceries on the same block in the the corner delis that we call bodegas (They are on almost every other block in this neighborhood). They also run hot grills for great sandwiches for a very great price.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]**About me:[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I am tied to and represent the freelancers' unions in Music, Film, and Events. I studied computer science in university but fell in love with set design and art department film work by way of living here as soon as I landed in the city. I have been lucky enough to learn from working with all the multi-cultural production designers, craftsman, dancers, film editors, computer programmers, screen writers, and musicians in the field, that I now hope to provide a sanctuary home for them as they pass through this amazing city. My home is permanently open to my international freelancers' family =).[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]For now, I am working on renovating a 100 year old hotel, trying to make sense of construction documents and how heating systems work. I love technology, so we usually have at least one techie in our midst working on something fun. I love music, as I grew up playing classical piano and saxophone (don't worry I don't play in the loft), so we have hosted many composers and traveling musicians.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]I spent most of my formative years in Taiwan, am now 31 years old, and bicultural between here and there, and keep a luggage identifier tag on my bag at all times to remind myself the need to travel, and by extension host and welcome people of all races, creeds, wholesome beliefs and lifestyles into my home. I have loved creating this space as meticulously with my freelancer family to promote a minimal but enriching living environment. Please share with me a bit about your passions and desires to share this spirit.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Last bits of info:[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Vacancy year round. Dates negotiable, but 1 Month minimum. Month-to-month is okay, many people use us as a temporary nest while they look for year leases. [newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Due to the high volume of requests, I cannot respond to all inquiries. In order to maintain the coworking ethos of the space, I usually give slight preference to visitors who have already secured a concrete project to work on while they are here in NYC. Regardless, please give me a good sense of who you are. I really appreciate it.[newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Most who come stay with us are postgraduate students, artists/designers, and entrepreneurs in from late 20's onwards in age, both males and females. We maintain a very clean space, and always wash our dishes immediately after eating, wipe down countertops after meal preparations, pick up our personal things from the common areas, etc. It's really important to me that my guests are mature and know how to share time and space with others. It's the key to this place being consistently peaceful and productive![newLine][newLine][newLine][newLine]Thank you for considering our space as your potential new nest and creative muse![newLine][newLine]"
