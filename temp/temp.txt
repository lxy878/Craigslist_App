Your future roomies have done an amazing job furnishing the kitchen and the living room, so it's such a pleasant space to live in! The apartment also has a deck with outdoor chairs and a table, and it's super nice for working or reading outside on nice days. If you have a bike, there's a shed with a lock outside for you to store it. There's a coin-operated washer and dryer for the building on site.
