Located at 89 Palmer Street in Stamford, CT, this corner house with a white picket fence is a commuter's dream on a quiet, tree-lined, residential street that is a VERY SHORT WALK to the Springdale Metro North station. Check it out on the map and think about that for a sec - no driving to the station and all the expense that incurs (assuming you can even get a permit space  - the waitlist for Springdale can be many mths+), no digging your car out of the snow, scraping the windows and warming it up prior to having to commute - just a pleasant, safe, short, convenient walk passing convenience stores, bistros, after work bars and nightlife, kid care, dry cleaning etc...[newLine]Old Springdale is a quiet residential area north of downtown Stamford with its own nightlife and "village" feel. Three, short, tree-lined, blocks (6-8 minute) to Springdale Metro North Train Station with a direct ride to and from to Grand Central during rush hours (45-50 min to GCT and, opposed to getting on at Stamford, you'll almost always get a seat ;-) and an easy walk to pharmacies, dry-cleaning, banks, major regional USPS Post Office, Auto-body shop, NAPA Auto parts store, Wholesale fish market, FARMER'S MARKET, ice-skating rink, multiple Sports Clubs, Bobby Valentine's Sports Academy, Trampoline park, tanning salon, Zumba classes, EXCELLENT local library, restaurants, main run movie theater, art cinema, schools and many many more neighborhood amenities. The "Best Pizza" and "Best Italian Bakery" in Stamford are just down the hill. This house is not on the busy, loud main thoroughfare (Hope Street) packed with condos, loud neighbors and rumbling diesel belching buses and trucks, but on a quiet, tree lined, pleasant side street giving you easy, walkable access to all the businesses and amenities without the downside.[newLine]This SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE (not "townhouse" or "condo" with neighbors on either side of thin walls and cramped public spaces) has 3 bright, sun filled bedrooms and 2 full baths. There is a bright sun-room surrounded by a huge deck. Built in the 1895, it still has all the charm of a classic old colonial but has been freshly polished and refurbished. It has brand new Kitchen tile floors and brand new Bath tile floors (both). It has refinished wood floors throughout with beautiful dappled sunlight streaming through traditional 6 pane sash windows. It has a recently painted interior. There's an oil burning boiler that provides heat and endless hot water (as long as you have oil ;-). There is a full kitchen with GE Profile appliances. The stove is GAS BURNING (take note Chef's - not electric). There is a washer and dryer in your empty, huge WALK OUT basement (Previous tenants rode into and worked on their motorcycles in this basement). There is a FENCED IN backyard for your pets, with towering and flowering trees (an enormous Dogwood and a majestic King Crimson Maple) and a huge deck perfect for outdoor BBQ'ing in the summer. There is carport covered parking just for you, plus plenty of regular on-street parking. There are beautiful planted perennials all over, a terraced side yard with climbing roses and a huge hydrangea, another side yard with arbor vitae, forsythia, large hydrangea, aromatic lilacs, Rose of Sharon, pachysandra, and evergreens all over - plus a sunny space with lots of compost for you to try out your own green thumb if you wish. All general structure, appliance maintenance and major landscaping are included in the rent.[newLine]The immediate walkable area has lots of child friendly activities and stores - you won't have to drive to them -- Kids U, My Gym, a kids consignment store, etc. . . . There is local professional day-care conducive to commuting parent(s) - Bright Horizons and Building Blocks are extremely close, JCC and others are short drives. A pleasant neighborhood park is walkable just up the hill, with a pond, turtles, ducks and rabbits galore. The Weed Hill branch of the Ferguson library is a walkable local hidden gem with many activities and classes for kids of all ages. Zoned schools are - Springdale Elementary (easily walkable and the recently the recipient of several major educational awards), Dolan Middle School (a walk of about 15-20 minutes) and Stamford HS (a drive of about 5-10 minutes). There are also lotteries for the numerous excellent magnet school options in Stamford. Cove Island Park is always a draw in the summer and a boat slip and marina permit can be obtained from City Hall. An ice cream store in the local shopping district is a kid-favorite. There are art films and major releases at the theaters two blocks away. Residents walk to take advantage of all the activities and classes nearby -- Bobby Valentine's, a national gymnastics training center, Sacred Heart University extension *and* you can easily drive to the UCONN Business School, NCC, etc. . . It is a short easy drive to downtown Stamford, New Canaan, I-95 (exit #9 Glenbrook Road) or the Merritt Parkway (exit #36 Old Stamford Road). Hedge fund alley is on your doorstep and with the train to Stamford (UBS/RBS) and New York City mid-town a stone's throw away, the world is your "oyster" ;-)[newLine]Administrivia -- Utilities, routine lawncare (e.g. grass/hedge trimming, weed removal), gutter/eave cleaning, leaf and snow/ice removal are the responsibility of the tenant and are not included in the rent. Referrals, employment verification and a credit check are required. First month, and a two month security deposit needed for move in (we can spread the payment of the security deposit over three months). A pet deposit required per pet if you have them. The one car garage is not included. Tenant(s) must carry rental insurance. [newLine]"

Boasting a 12' ceiling, hardwood flooring, three over-sized lace-clad windows, and a classic fireplace mantle, the apartment, in all its exquisite pre-war detail, extends to nearly 327 square feet. [newLine]The furniture, too, consists of carefully curated, individual pieces: an antique 19th century iron bed (resized to queen), an 18th century armoire from France's Provence region, a stylish slip-covered sofa, and an oriental wool rug. The list goes on: you can keep your clothes in a Victorian-era chest of drawers or leave your purse on a circa 1870 American Empire card table. The walls are adorned with reproductions of the prints of Toulouse-Lautrec and others, with a gilded mirror above the fireplace.[newLine]The apartment's en-suite bathroom is simple and clutter-less. A pedestal sink accompanies a full size en-suite bathtub with shower.

The generously sized apartment-style suites are housed within a 5-story classic 1870's era brownstone on an inviting residential street. The historic turn-of-the-century brownstone townhouse brings style and quaintness to the busy city. Views of beautiful East 62nd Street Mansions or serene garden views. The wonderful stylized apartments of the townhouse offer antique furniture, hardwood floors, beautiful beds, en suite private bathrooms, as well as high ceilings, marble fireplace mantels and modern amenities such as flat-screen TVs and complimentary Wi-Fi. Some rooms offer a kitchen or kitchenette and separate dining areas. The house's Garden Room features a beautiful private garden terrace. The Madison and Lexington Suites feature separate bedrooms.Set on a tree-lined street, 1871's beautiful brownstone building is situated in the much sought after LENOX HILL neighborhood of the Historic Upper East Side section of Manhattan and a 5-minute walk to CENTRAL PARK. Bloomingdales &amp; Barneys New York (Madison Avenue) are within a couple of blocks away. Yet, the house is only three blocks from bustling Midtown Manhattan and some of the City's fabulous and world renown Museums &amp; galleries including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Met Breuer, MoMA and the Frick Museum.

[newLine]The furniture, too, consists of carefully curated, individual pieces: an antique 19th century iron bed (resized to queen), an 18th century armoire from France's Provence region, a stylish slip-covered sofa, and an oriental wool rug. The list goes on: you can keep your clothes in a Victorian-era chest of drawers or leave your purse on a circa 1870 American Empire card table. The walls are adorned with reproductions of the prints of Toulouse-Lautrec and others, with a gilded mirror above the fireplace.[newLine]The apartment's en-suite bathroom is simple and clutter-less. A pedestal sink accompanies a full size en-suite bathtub with shower. The butlers pantry is fully equipped with open shelving, a refrigerator/freezer, microwave and toaster oven, sink, electric coffeemaker and kettle. Dishes are provided. Adjacent to the kitchenette is a round marble bistro table and chair set.[newLine]Please note Fireplace may not be used/ornamental only. [newLine]We regret we are unable to accommodate pets. All apartments are accessed via our central open staircase. Building not handicap accessible. [newLine]Tucked among gorgeous townhouses and other historic buildings between Park and Lexington Avenues, the Brownstone offers charming accommodations a couple of blocks from Central Park, Madison Avenue shopping and Manhattan's finest restaurants and cafes. The generously sized apartment-style suites are housed within a 5-story classic 1870's era brownstone on an inviting residential street. The historic turn-of-the-century brownstone townhouse brings style and quaintness to the busy city. Views of beautiful East 62nd Street Mansions or serene garden views. The wonderful stylized apartments of the townhouse offer antique furniture, hardwood floors, beautiful beds, en suite private bathrooms, as well as high ceilings, marble fireplace mantels and modern amenities such as flat-screen TVs and complimentary Wi-Fi. Some rooms offer a kitchen or kitchenette and separate dining areas. The house's Garden Room features a beautiful private garden terrace. The Madison and Lexington Suites feature separate bedrooms.Set on a tree-lined street, 1871's beautiful brownstone building is situated in the much sought after LENOX HILL neighborhood of the Historic Upper East Side section of Manhattan and a 5-minute walk to CENTRAL PARK. Bloomingdales &amp; Barneys New York (Madison Avenue) are within a couple of blocks away. Yet, the house is only three blocks from bustling Midtown Manhattan and some of the City's fabulous and world renown Museums &amp; galleries including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Met Breuer, MoMA and the Frick Museum. Carnegie Hall is 9 minutes away by Taxi or an 18 minute walk. Among subway lines near the house are the 4, 5, 6, F, R &amp; N and the new Q extension just 1 and 2 blocks from the house.[newLine]Uniquely, our private and intimate townhouse fully furnished apartments are perfect for your extended stay on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Book a full month in one of our spacious apartments for less than a two week stay at a traditional luxury hotel. We encourage you to compare! 30 day minimum stay required. Sales tax payable for stays under 180 days. [newLine]"
